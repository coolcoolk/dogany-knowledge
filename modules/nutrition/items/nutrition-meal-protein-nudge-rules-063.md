# Meal-protein sprint 2026-10-06. The
# engine-readable synthesis a meal module reads to decide WHETHER and HOW to
# nudge protein from a meal log. It is a routing rule, not a primary finding:
# each rule names the graded row it rests on, and every product constant (the
# logged-day minimum, the 7-day window, the 0.9 margin) is labelled as a
# constant. Same posture as exercise/caution-severity-ladder-056.
#
# target_bands and nudge_rules are structured data. Numbers in target_bands are
# g protein per kg body weight per day, copied from the graded items, for
# RESCALE against measured body weight -- never computed by the model. The
# YAML-subset reader returns scalars as strings; cast with float()/int().

refraction_notes:
  - note: >
      THE BANDS ARE THE EVIDENCE; THE WINDOW AND MARGIN ARE NOT. The daily
      bands are copied from 002 and 062. The 7-day window, the four-logged-day
      minimum, the 0.9 margin and the one-nudge-per-day cap are product
      constants chosen to keep nudges off log noise. Speak them as the app's
      rule, never as a threshold from research.
    grade: D
  - note: >
      NUDGE THE TOTAL, NOT THE PATTERN. Every rule that fires acts on the daily
      total. Skewed distribution, large single meals and distance from a
      workout never trigger a nudge on their own, because the evidence for
      correcting them is thin (009), refuted (008) or wide (exercise 002). A
      per-meal add-on is suggested only as the easiest place to close a daily
      gap, and that reason is stated.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      OLDER USERS GET A BIGGER ADD-ON, NOT A DIFFERENT RULE. The per-meal dose
      at 65+ is 0.4 g/kg rather than 0.25 g/kg, from one pooled retrospective
      tracer analysis in men whose body-mass difference was borderline. PROT-AGE
      itself calls timing evidence insufficient for a specific recommendation.
      Use the larger figure to size an add-on, never to grade a meal as failed.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      BODY WEIGHT MISSING -> ASK ONCE, THEN SPEAK IN EXCHANGES OR SKIP. Without
      a measured or stated weight, no g/kg band can be rescaled. Ask per the
      budget. Until then, do not invent a reference weight, and do not send the
      below-floor nudge.
    grade: D
claim: >
  A meal module should judge protein on the daily total, averaged over logged
  days, and nudge only when that total falls below the floor for the user's
  context. The floors are 1.4 g/kg body weight in general training, 1.6 g/kg in
  a deficit with resistance training, 1.0-1.2 g/kg for adults 65 and over, and
  1.2 g/kg for older adults who are losing weight. With a stated kidney
  condition there is no target and the user is routed to a clinician. When a
  nudge fires, it names the daily gap and suggests one per-meal dose added to
  the lowest-protein meal: about 0.25 g/kg (20-40 g) under 65, about 0.4 g/kg
  at 65 and over. Large meals, dinner-heavy days and protein eaten far from a
  workout never trigger a nudge by themselves, and nothing is ever called
  wasted.
reasoning: >
  This item turns graded rows into a decision table. It decides nothing that
  those rows do not already support. The bands carry their source grades:
  general from 002, deficit, older-adult and renal from 062. The pattern rules
  are deliberately null actions, because the evidence base for even
  distribution (009) and against large boluses (008) does not support
  correction, and the timing meta-regression found total intake, not timing,
  to be the predictor. The only place distribution re-enters is as craft (021):
  adding one dose to the poorest meal is the most loggable way to close a daily
  gap, and the rule says so. Log-handling rules come from the measurement items.
  The logged figure is a floor (007) and a missing day is not zero (019), which
  is why the window averages logged days only and requires a minimum count. The
  window length, the minimum count and the margin have no evidence behind them
  and are labelled as product constants, which keeps the whole item at the
  practitioner band.

# nutrition/meal-protein-nudge-rules-063 -- 식단 모듈의 단백질 넛지 규칙

**한 줄 그림:** 끼니가 아니라 하루 총량을 본다. 기록된 날들의 평균이 맥락별 하한보다 낮을 때만 한 번
권하고, 그 외에는 아무 말도 하지 않는다.

## Target bands (g per kg body weight per day)

| Context | Floor | Upper | Basis |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| general (under 65) | 1.4 | 2.0 | 002 |
| deficit + resistance training (under 65) | 1.6 | 2.4 | 062 |
| 65+, not dieting | 1.0 (1.2 if active) | -- | 062 |
| 65+, losing weight | 1.2 | -- | 062 |
| stated kidney condition | -- | -- | withhold, refer (062) |

## Nudge table

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| fewer than 4 logged days in 7 | no nudge |
| 7-day logged mean < 0.9 x floor | one nudge: gap in g/day (KR: gap / 8 exchanges), add one per-meal dose to the lowest meal |
| in band or above | none |
| one meal > 40 g | none, never "wasted" |
| dinner-heavy day | none on its own |
| no protein near workout | none, no 30-60 minute window |
| short and no evening protein | may offer about 30-40 g before sleep as one option |

The 7-day window, the 4-day minimum, the 0.9 margin and the one-per-day cap are
product constants.

## 한국어 요약 (답변용)

- 단백질은 끼니 하나, 하루 하나로 판단하지 않는다. 최근 7일 중 **기록된 날**의 평균으로 본다. 기록된
  날이 4일보다 적으면 권하지 않는다. 기록 안 된 날을 0으로 세지 않는다.
- 하한(일반 1.4, 감량 중 근력 운동 1.6, 65세 이상 1.0~1.2, 감량 중 고령 1.2 g/kg)의 90% 밑일 때만
  하루 한 번 권한다. 부족분을 하루 그램으로 말하고, 한국 식단이면 8로 나눠 어육류 교환 수로 말한다.
- 권할 때는 "기록상"이라고 말한다. 실제 섭취는 기록보다 많을 가능성이 높다.
- 보충은 단백질이 가장 적은 끼니에 한 번 분량(65세 미만 약 0.25 g/kg, 20~40 g / 65세 이상 약
  0.4 g/kg)을 더하는 방식으로 제안한다. 이유는 생리학이 아니라 지키기 쉽고 기록하기 쉬워서다.
- 한 끼에 40 g을 넘게 먹어도 "낭비"라고 하지 않는다. 저녁에 몰아 먹는 것도, 운동 직후에 안 먹는
  것도 그 자체로는 권할 이유가 아니다.
- 하루가 부족하고 저녁에 단백질이 없으면 자기 전 30~40 g 간식을 여러 방법 중 하나로 제안할 수 있다.
  다른 시간에 먹는 것보다 낫다고 말하지 않는다.
- 콩팥 질환이 있다고 밝힌 사람에게는 목표치도 권유도 주지 않고 담당 의료진에게 연결한다.
- 7일, 4일, 90%, 하루 한 번은 앱이 정한 규칙이다. 연구에서 나온 기준처럼 말하지 않는다.
