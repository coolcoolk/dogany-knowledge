      RE-AUDIT, UNIT ERROR CORRECTED. The often-quoted 2.3-3.1 g/kg band for
      keeping lean mass in a deficit comes from Helms 2014, which states it per
      kilogram of FAT-FREE MASS. The ISSN 2017 stand reprinted it as g/kg/d with
      no qualifier, and nutrition/protein-intake-002 inherited that reading.
      Applied to body weight it overstates the target for anyone carrying body
      fat. At 20 percent body fat, 2.3-3.1 g/kg FFM is about 1.8-2.5 g/kg body
      weight, which sits inside the 1.6-2.4 g/kg body-weight band this item
      rescales. Never multiply 2.3-3.1 by total body weight.
    grade: A
  - note: >
      THE UPPER END IS NOT SETTLED. Under energy balance, Morton 2018 found a
      plateau near 1.6 g/kg (CI 1.03-2.20; the two-phase fit itself was not
      significant, p=0.079). In a deficit, Refalo 2025 found a linear rise with
      no plateau, but the per-body-weight slope interval crosses zero and the
      authors call the result exploratory. A 2026 commentary adds that people
      who already eat a lot of protein may gain less from more. Speak 1.6 as
      the evidence-backed floor and 2.4 as the upper end of current guidance.
      Do not present a figure above 2.4 g/kg body weight as needed.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      THE HIGH END IS FOR THE LEAN, THE LONG AND THE HARD-DIETING. Refalo's
      dose-response was stronger at lower body fat, in interventions longer than
      four weeks and in men. Hector and Phillips set the end of the range by
      deficit severity and training load. A user with plenty of body fat on a
      modest deficit is well served near the bottom of the band. A lean user on
      a long, steep cut is the case for the top.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      PROTEIN DOES NOT BUY BACK A STEEP DEFICIT. Across RT trials, a deficit of
      about 500 kcal/day was enough to stop lean-mass gains, while strength
      gains held. More protein is one lever. The size of the deficit (012) and
      continued resistance training are the others, and protein cannot replace
      either.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      OLDER ADULTS: A HIGHER FLOOR, A THINNER CEILING. For people over 65, the
      PROT-AGE and ESPEN expert groups set at least 1.0-1.2 g/kg/day, 1.2 or more
      for the active, and 1.2-1.5 with acute or chronic illness. In older adults
      losing weight, higher-protein diets kept more lean mass (20 RCTs). With
      resistance training, the lean-mass benefit appeared at 1.2-1.59 g/kg/day
      at 65+ (Nunes 2022). No trial was found that tests the 1.6-2.4 band in
      older adults who are dieting. For an older dieting user, the floor to
      speak is 1.2 g/kg. The 1.6-2.4 band is an extrapolation from younger
      samples (GAPS.md).
    grade: B
  - note: >
      KIDNEY BOUNDARY. In adults without kidney disease, higher-protein diets
      did not change GFR over time (28 RCTs). In stated chronic kidney disease
      the target here does NOT apply. KDIGO 2024 suggests 0.8 g/kg/day for CKD
      G3-G5 and avoiding more than 1.3 g/kg/day where CKD is at risk of
      progressing. That is a low-certainty (2C) recommendation, but it is the
      recommendation. When renal_condition is stated and is not none or
      healthy, withdraw the specific number and refer to the user's clinician.
      When it is unknown, give the number with the general-population caveat.
      Do not block it, because the healthy-adult kidney data are reassuring.
    grade: A
claim: >
  During an energy deficit with resistance training, daily protein of about
  1.6-2.4 g per kg of body weight is the current recommended range for keeping
  lean mass. The low end is the better-supported floor. The upper end is
  guidance, and the size of any benefit above the floor is unresolved. Two RCTs
  anchor the range. In a 31-day deficit, 1.6 and 2.4 g/kg both reduced the share
  of weight lost as fat-free mass compared with 0.8 g/kg. In a steep four-week
  deficit with intense training, 2.4 g/kg produced a lean-mass gain (+1.2 kg)
  where 1.2 g/kg produced none (+0.1 kg). The often-quoted 2.3-3.1 g/kg band is
  per kg of fat-free mass, not body weight. For adults over 65, expert groups set
  a floor of at least 1.0-1.2 g/kg/day, rising to 1.2 or more when active or
  ill. In older adults losing weight, higher protein retains more lean mass. In
  stated chronic kidney disease these targets do not apply.
reasoning: >
  The direction (more protein than the 0.8 g/kg adult RDA keeps more lean mass
  during weight loss) is consistent across controlled trials in young adults,
  athletes and older adults, and across expert groups. That puts the claim at the
  RCT-level band. It stops short of the top because the deficit-specific trials
  are small and short (n=39-40, 4-5 weeks). The one deficit-specific
  dose-response synthesis is self-described as exploratory, its body-weight slope
  interval crosses zero, and the energy-balance plateau it is set against was
  itself not statistically significant. That disagreement over the upper end is
  the contested flag. The floor is not contested. The re-audit finding is the
  part that changes a shipped number. The FFM-based 2.3-3.1 band lost its unit
  between Helms 2014 and the ISSN 2017 stand. Item 002 spoke it against body
  weight, which would hand a 90 kg user with 25 percent body fat a target of up
  to 279 g/day instead of about 209 g (3.1 x 67.5 kg FFM). That is a material
  overstatement, so this item takes ownership of the deficit target and 002's
  note is corrected to point here. The older-adult floor is expert consensus
  resting on tracer and RCT data. It is stated as a floor, not a ceiling, and
  the absence of a deficit trial in older adults at the athletic band is carried
  as a gap rather than filled by extrapolation. The kidney gate is hard because
  the one population with a guideline against high protein is exactly the one
  the healthy-adult GFR data exclude.

# nutrition/protein-deficit-lean-mass-target-062

When someone is losing weight and lifting, the protein question is how much to
eat so that the weight lost is mostly fat. The current answer is about 1.6 to 2.4
grams per kilogram of body weight a day. Two randomised trials carry most of the
weight. In one, both 1.6 and 2.4 g/kg protected fat-free mass better than the
standard adult allowance. In the other, young men on a steep four-week deficit
with hard training gained lean mass on 2.4 g/kg and none on 1.2 g/kg.

The top of the range is less certain than the bottom. A 2025 meta-regression of
29 deficit studies found the benefit kept rising with intake and never levelled
off. Its authors call that result exploratory, and the interval on the
body-weight slope includes zero. The best-known plateau estimate, around 1.6
g/kg, comes mostly from people who were not dieting, and its fitted curve was not
statistically significant either. So 1.6 is the floor to lean on. 2.4 is where
current guidance stops, not a proven extra gain.

One widely repeated number had the wrong unit. The 2.3 to 3.1 g/kg band traces
back to a 2014 review that gives it per kilogram of fat-free mass. A 2017
position stand reprinted it without that qualifier, and this warehouse's general
protein item picked it up. Multiplied by total body weight, it inflates the
target for anyone with body fat. Converted correctly, it lands inside the
1.6-2.4 band.

## 한국어 요약 (답변용)

- 감량 중에 근력 운동을 하면서 근육을 지키려면 단백질은 하루 **체중 1 kg당 1.6~2.4 g**이 현재 권고
  범위다. 근거가 단단한 쪽은 하한 1.6이다. 2.4는 지금 권고가 닿는 상한일 뿐, 더 먹으면 더 지켜진다는
  게 확인된 숫자가 아니다.
- 흔히 도는 "2.3~3.1 g/kg"는 **제지방량 1 kg당** 숫자다. 체중에 곱하면 과대 계산이 된다. 체지방
  20%인 사람이면 체중 기준 약 1.8~2.5 g/kg로, 위 범위 안에 들어온다.
- 범위의 위쪽은 마른 사람이 오래, 세게 감량할 때 쓰는 값이다. 체지방이 넉넉하고 적자가 크지 않으면
  아래쪽으로도 충분하다.
- 단백질로 큰 적자를 메울 수는 없다. 하루 500 kcal 정도의 적자에서도 근육 증가는 멈췄다(근력은
  유지). 적자 크기와 근력 운동 지속이 같이 가야 한다.
- 65세 이상은 평소에도 하루 최소 **1.0~1.2 g/kg**, 운동하거나 아프면 1.2 이상이 전문가 권고다.
  감량 중인 고령자에게는 1.2 g/kg를 하한으로 말한다. 1.6~2.4는 젊은 사람 연구에서 옮겨온 값이다.
- 만성 콩팥병이 있다고 밝힌 사람에게는 이 숫자를 주지 않고 담당 의료진에게 연결한다. KDIGO
  2024는 3~5기에서 0.8 g/kg를 권하고, 진행 위험이 있으면 1.3 g/kg를 넘기지 말라고 한다. 콩팥 질환이
  없는 성인에서는 고단백 식사가 사구체여과율 변화를 만들지 않았다.
