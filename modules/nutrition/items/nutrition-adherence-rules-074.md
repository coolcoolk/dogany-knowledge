# Diet-adherence sprint 2026-10-07.
# The engine-readable synthesis of 025 (restraint style), 026 (diet breaks,
# refeeds), 027 (self-monitoring frequency) and 073 (weekend drift), for the
# diet card (diet-status) and the weekly retro (week-health).
# It is a routing rule, not a primary finding: each rule names the graded
# row it rests on, and every product constant is labelled as one. Same
# posture as exercise/caution-severity-ladder-056.
#
# adherence_rules is structured data (see the adherence-rules field guide (not public)).
# The YAML-subset reader returns every scalar as a string; flow lists parse
# natively. No program code was changed.

refraction_notes:
  - note: >
      THE RULES ARE GRADED, THE NUMBERS ARE NOT. Every rule's direction rests
      on its basis row. The 3:1 block, the 2-week comparison window, the
      minimum logged days and the 7-day look-ahead are product constants.
      Speak them as the plan's rule, never as a tested threshold.
    grade: D
  - note: >
      CARRY-OVER IS ALREADY BOUNDED; KEEP IT THAT WAY. The diet-status
      carry-over spreads a surplus over the remaining days of the declared
      week under the calorie floor and never crosses a week boundary. That
      matches 073 (weekday compensation goes with success) and 025 (no
      punishment day). A Sunday surplus therefore surfaces in the weekly
      retro as the weekend-gap lever, not as debt into next week.
    grade: D
  - note: >
      ADHERENCE IS THE OUTCOME VARIABLE, DIET TYPE MOSTLY IS NOT. In a
      year-long trial of three very different diets, weight change tracked
      adherence within each diet. A stall is checked against adherence
      before a diet change is entertained. Secondary analysis, self-reported
      adherence: direction only.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      NO SAFETY AXIS GATES THESE RULES. An eating-disorder history would
      arguably gate weighing and break advice, but no such axis exists on
      the ledger (framework-owned); weighing-exit is a conversational
      trigger until one does (GAPS.md).
    grade: D
claim: >
  The diet card and the weekly retro apply eleven adherence rules: phrase
  plans without all-or-nothing language and resume at the next meal; check
  adherence before entertaining a diet switch; offer optional diet breaks at
  maintenance as an appetite tool, showing the later end date, and do not
  judge a break week's weight; ask for short entries at the meal; read a drop
  in logged days against the user's own prior weeks as an early sign without
  a prescribed minimum; show weight only as a weekly mean or same-weekday
  comparison and never judge a single reading; switch off daily weighing for
  users who report distress or disordered eating; never let a Monday reading
  trigger feedback; name a measured weekend-versus-weekday intake gap in the
  user's own numbers; and preview multi-day holidays. Directions are backed
  by 025-027 and 073 (B to C); thresholds are product constants.
reasoning: >
  Each rule is a routing of one graded row into a surface the product
  already has, so the item adds no new finding and is graded as a synthesis.
  The strongest rules are the two about breaks, which rest on randomised
  trials (026). The phrasing, monitoring and weekend rules rest on
  consistent observational evidence (025, 027, 073) and say only what that
  evidence allows: directions, not doses. Where the evidence is silent the
  rule says less, not more -- no minimum logging days, no weekend kcal
  figure imported from US data, no Korean holiday effect size. The weekend
  gap is computed only from complete logged days on both sides because an
  unlogged day is missing data (019) and the kit already defines a complete
  day; dropping a day from one side only would manufacture a gap. The
  adherence-before-switch rule borrows one secondary analysis from the
  diet-comparison literature, carried at its own observational grade.

# nutrition/adherence-rules-074 -- 식단 카드·주간 회고용 지속(adherence) 규칙

**한 줄 그림:** 식단은 종류보다 지키는 정도가 결과를 가른다. 그래서 카드와 회고는 '하루 판정'이
아니라 '다음 끼니와 이번 주'를 말한다.

## The rules

| Rule | Surface | Trigger | Action | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| no-all-or-nothing | diet card | over-target meal/day | resume at next meal; week total, no verdict | 025 |
| adherence-before-diet-switch | weekly retro | flat week + user wants new diet | check adherence first | A TO Z |
| diet-break-offer | diet card | hunger up / asks | optional maintenance break, later end date shown | 026 |
| break-week-weight | weekly retro | break/refeed week | not judged against loss target | 026 |
| log-at-the-meal | diet card | logging prompt | one short entry at the meal | 027 |
| logging-frequency-signal | weekly retro | fewer complete days than 2 prior weeks | mention once, own numbers | 027 |
| weigh-as-trend | both | any weight | weekly mean / same weekday | 027 |
| weighing-exit | both | distress / ED history / repeated checking | daily weighing off, not re-offered | 027 |
| like-day-comparison | weekly retro | body-trend line | Monday alone never triggers | 073 |
| weekend-gap | weekly retro | ≥2 weekend + ≥3 weekday complete days, weekend higher | name the gap in own kcal | 073 |
| holiday-preview | diet card | 명절 / long weekend within 7 days | one planning line | 073 |

Directions come from the basis rows. The 3:1 break block, the 2-week window,
the minimum logged days and the 7-day look-ahead are product constants.

## 한국어 요약 (답변용)

- 목표를 넘긴 끼니나 날에는 "실패", "망쳤다", "치팅" 같은 말을 쓰지 않는다. 다음 끼니에서
  이어 가면 되고, 판단은 하루가 아니라 주 단위로 한다.
- 정체된 주에 사용자가 식단 종류를 바꾸자고 하면, 먼저 지금 식단을 얼마나 지켰는지 기록으로
  확인한다. 잘 지켰는데도 정체일 때만 변경을 논의한다.
- 배고픔이 커지거나 지친다고 하면 유지 칼로리로 먹는 다이어트 브레이크를 선택지로 제안할 수
  있다. 이때 늦어지는 목표 날짜를 함께 보여 준다. 브레이크 주의 체중은 감량 목표로 평가하지 않는다.
- 기록은 끼니 직후 짧게. 기록한 날이 지난 2주보다 줄면 한 번만, 사용자 본인 숫자로 짚는다.
  "주 며칠은 기록해야 빠진다" 같은 기준은 말하지 않는다.
- 체중은 주 평균이나 같은 요일끼리 비교한다. 월요일 숫자 하나로 피드백하지 않는다.
- 체중계 때문에 괴롭다거나 섭식 문제 이력을 말하면 매일 측정 권유를 끄고 다시 꺼내지 않는다.
- 기록이 충분한 주에 주말 섭취가 평일보다 높으면, 그 차이를 사용자 본인 kcal로 이번 주 조정
  포인트로 짚는다. 기록 없는 날은 양쪽 평균에서 모두 뺀다.
- 명절이나 긴 연휴가 일주일 안에 있으면 미리 한 줄로 짚는다. 금지가 아니라 계획이다.
- 숫자 기준(3주 감량:1주 유지, 2주 비교 창, 최소 기록일, 7일 예고)은 제품이 정한 규칙이다.
  연구로 정해진 기준처럼 말하지 않는다.
