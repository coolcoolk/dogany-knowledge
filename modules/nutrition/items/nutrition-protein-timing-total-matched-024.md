# Authored 2026-10-07. The timing claims a
# lifter meets around a training day -- pre vs post, "around the session",
# casein before bed -- read for one question: once the DAILY TOTAL is matched,
# is anything left? The window WIDTH claim stays with
# exercise/protein-anabolic-window-002 (single ownership); this item owns the
# total-matched reading and the Korean day shape the diet card actually sees
# (breakfast skipped, protein loaded at dinner or late). Primaries read
# 2026-10-07.
#
# timing_rules is structured data for diet-status (protein nudge, last-call
# line, card copy). No program code was changed by this item.

  - note: >
      THE BEDTIME RESULT IS AN EXTRA-PROTEIN RESULT. Snijders 2015 compared a
      27.5 g pre-sleep drink with a non-caloric placebo, so the protein group
      simply ate more protein each day. When Joy 2018 moved the same 35 g of
      casein between day and bedtime on matched 1.8 g/kg diets, nothing
      separated (n=13, preliminary). Read pre-sleep protein as one more slot
      in which to reach the total.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      NO TIMING TRIAL IN A DEFICIT. None of the timing trials located ran in a
      calorie deficit in trained lifters. That timing matters more in a cut
      is a plausible theory and is not tested; it is not spoken as a finding.
    grade: D
  - note: >
      KOREAN DAY SHAPE. In the 2024 national survey as reported, about six in
      ten Koreans aged 19-29 skip breakfast. The one KNHANES study of protein
      across meals located covers only adults over 60 and found an even but
      low spread; no per-meal protein profile of young Korean lifters was
      found. A dinner-heavy day is treated as normal, not as an error.
    grade: C
claim: >
  When the daily protein total is matched, the timing of protein around
  training does not measurably change strength or muscle gain. A
  meta-regression of 23 hypertrophy and 20 strength studies found the small
  pooled timing effect disappeared once total protein intake was accounted for,
  and total intake was the strongest predictor. In resistance-trained men, 25 g
  immediately before training and 25 g immediately after gave the same 10-week
  results. Protein before sleep improved gains against a non-caloric placebo,
  but in that trial the protein group also ate more protein per day; when the
  same casein dose was moved between daytime and bedtime with totals matched,
  no difference appeared. For the diet card this means: the remaining daily
  total comes first, the session and bedtime are convenient slots to reach it,
  and a skipped breakfast or a dinner-heavy Korean day is not a defect.
reasoning: >
  The direction is supported by a meta-regression and by an RCT in the target
  population with matched doses, which puts the core claim at the RCT-level
  band; it is not contested in print in its total-matched form. The pre-sleep
  part is held lower because its positive trial did not match totals and its
  matched trial has 13 people. The Korean breakfast figure is a secondary press
  report of the KDCA survey, and the only Korean per-meal protein study located
  is in older adults, so the Korean rule rests on the distribution evidence
  (009, 008) rather than on a Korean outcome study. Nothing here sets a
  minute window; the width of the window belongs to the exercise-owned item.

# nutrition/protein-timing-total-matched-024

Once the day's protein total is the same, when it is eaten around training
makes no measurable difference to strength or muscle over weeks. The pooled
timing studies show a small effect only until total protein is accounted for,
and then it disappears. Trained men who took the same 25 g just before or
just after lifting ended ten weeks in the same place.

The bedtime-protein finding is the one people cite as a timing effect, and it
is really a quantity effect. The trial that found bigger gains gave the
protein group an extra drink and the control group a calorie-free placebo. The
small trial that moved the same casein between daytime and bedtime, with daily
protein held equal, found no difference.

Applied to a Korean day: most people in their twenties skip breakfast, and
protein tends to arrive at lunch, dinner or a late meal. None of that needs
correcting. The diet card's job is to keep the daily total in view and to use
whatever meals are left, including a shake before bed, as places to reach it.

## 한국어 요약 (답변용)

- 하루 단백질 총량이 같다면, 운동 전후 언제 먹느냐로 근육·근력 결과가 달라진다는 근거는 없다.
  부족한 날에는 남은 총량부터 말한다.
- 운동 직전 25 g과 직후 25 g은 훈련자 10주 시험에서 결과가 같았다. "운동 후 30분 안에"는
  지키라고 말하지 않는다.
- 자기 전 단백질이 효과가 있었다는 연구는 대조군이 열량 없는 위약이라 사실상 "더 먹은" 효과다.
  총량을 맞추고 시간만 바꾼 작은 시험에서는 차이가 없었다. 자기 전은 총량을 채우는 편한 자리일 뿐이다.
- 20대의 약 60%가 아침을 거른다(2024 국민건강영양조사 보도). 아침을 안 먹은 것을 문제로 짚지 않고,
  실제로 먹는 끼니로 총량을 나눈다. 아침 칸이 비어 있으면 사용자가 거른 것이라고 말하기 전까지는
  '모름'이다.
- 저녁·회식·야식에 단백질이 몰려도 전부 총량에 넣는다. "한 끼에 너무 많다"는 경고는 하지 않는다.
- 감량 중에 타이밍이 더 중요하다는 말은 시험된 적이 없다. 사실처럼 말하지 않는다.
