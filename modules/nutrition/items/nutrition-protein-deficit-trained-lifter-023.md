# Authored 2026-10-07. Protein for a
# trained lifter in a calorie deficit -- the case the diet card meets on every
# cut day. Owned elsewhere and NOT restated here: the general daily range
# (002), the per-meal ceiling dispute (008), the distribution question (009),
# the rate of loss (012), Korean exchange arithmetic (021), the training-timing
# window (exercise/protein-anabolic-window-002). This item owns only what
# changes when the lifter is in a deficit, and the reading of the two numbers
# the diet engine already uses (Morton 2018's 2.2 and Schoenfeld & Aragon
# 2018's 0.4 / 0.55), each re-read at the primary on 2026-10-07.
#
# protein_rules is structured data for diet-status (protein day target and
# nudge caps). Values are per kg of BODY WEIGHT unless the unit field says
# otherwise. No program code was changed by this item.
# Renumbered at the v37 merge (provisional 070 -> 023). Written in parallel
# with nutrition/protein-deficit-lean-mass-target-062, which OWNS the deficit
# target band (same 1.6-2.4 g/kg, same core trials); this row carries the
# trained-lifter reading of the engine's numbers and the protein_rules the
# diet-status code reads (product 0.33.0 applies them).

      THE FLOOR IS THE SUPPORTED PART. Every deficit trial located that compared
      roughly 1.0-1.2 g/kg against roughly 2.3-2.4 g/kg favoured the higher arm
      for lean mass (Mettler 2010, Longland 2016), and Pasiakos 2013 found both
      1.6 and 2.4 better than 0.8. No trial in trained lifters in a deficit
      separated 1.6 from 2.4. So "at least 1.6 in a cut" carries the evidence;
      the choice inside 1.6-2.4 is a judgement on leanness and deficit size.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      UNIT TRAP. The often-quoted 2.3-3.1 g/kg deficit band (Helms 2014) is per
      kilogram of FAT-FREE MASS, not body weight. For an 80 kg lifter at 15
      percent body fat it is about 156-211 g a day, not 184-248 g. Item 002's
      carve-out note quotes the band without the unit; read it through this
      note. Without a body-fat value, quote the body-weight band only.
    grade: A
  - note: >
      2.2 IS NOT A CEILING. Morton 2018's plateau at 1.62 g/kg is an unadjusted,
      non-significant break point (p=0.079) whose 95 percent interval runs to
      2.20, built from trials that were mostly at energy balance and that
      topped out at 2.4 g/kg. The authors suggest about 2.2 as a prudent target
      for someone maximising gains; that is a recommendation, not a measured
      upper limit, and it says nothing about a deficit, where the trials that
      exist used 2.3-2.4.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      SMALL, SHORT TRIALS. The deficit RCTs ran two to four weeks with 20-40
      people; Longland's subjects were young men whose resistance-training
      history the registry does not record, and Pasiakos's were not lifters.
      The direction is consistent; effect sizes are not transportable to a
      12-week cut.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      KIDNEYS ARE THE ONE HARD GATE. Known chronic kidney disease withdraws the
      cut band (KDIGO 2024 advises avoiding more than 1.3 g/kg/day when CKD is
      at risk of progressing). No evidence located shows harm from 1.6-2.4 g/kg
      in people with normal kidney function, and none is claimed here.
    grade: D
claim: >
  For a resistance-trained adult in a calorie deficit, daily protein of at least
  about 1.6 g per kg of body weight is supported, and the working band is
  1.6-2.4 g/kg, moving toward the top as the person gets leaner and the deficit
  gets steeper. Short randomised deficit trials consistently favoured about
  2.3-2.4 g/kg over 1.0-1.2 g/kg for lean mass (Mettler 2010, n=20 trained
  athletes, -0.3 vs -1.6 kg; Longland 2016, n=40, +1.2 vs +0.1 kg), while 1.6
  and 2.4 g/kg were not separated in the one trial that tested both (Pasiakos
  2013, non-lifters). The 2.3-3.1 figure from Helms 2014 is per kg of fat-free
  mass. The 2.2 g/kg figure from Morton 2018 is the upper end of a confidence
  interval around a non-significant break point from mostly energy-balance
  trials, not a ceiling for a cut. The 0.4 and 0.55 g/kg per-meal figures from
  Schoenfeld & Aragon 2018 are distribution targets across at least four meals,
  not limits on what one meal can use.
reasoning: >
  The floor rests on randomised trials with a consistent direction and on two
  meta-analyses that place the lean-mass benefit at or above about 1.6 g/kg, so
  it sits at the RCT-level band. The upper end is held lower and flagged
  contested: the reviews that argue for higher intakes in lean dieters (Helms
  2014, 6 small studies) and the one trial that tested 1.6 against 2.4 and found
  no separation (Pasiakos 2013) point in different directions, and none of it is
  in trained lifters over a full cut. Two readings of shipped numbers were
  corrected at the primary. Morton's 2.2 was never a measured limit; the
  full text gives p=0.079 for the break point and an interval of 1.03-2.20, and
  the trials in it reached only 2.4 g/kg. Schoenfeld & Aragon state 0.4 g/kg/meal
  as a target intake and 0.55 as the arithmetic of 2.2 over four meals, in a
  paper whose own conclusion is that protein above 20 g is not all oxidised;
  using either as an absorption cap inverts the paper. The renal gate is the one
  safety axis with a guideline behind it, and it is a practice point, so it is
  carried as a gate with its weak basis named.

# nutrition/protein-deficit-trained-lifter-023

In a cut, protein is the lever that most clearly protects muscle, and the
supported part is a floor: about 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight per day
or more. Short deficit trials that put trained or hard-training people on
roughly 2.3-2.4 g/kg against roughly 1.0-1.2 g/kg kept or gained more lean mass
in the higher group. Inside 1.6-2.4 the evidence does not pick a number, and the
usual coaching move (lean and dieting hard -> nearer the top) is a judgement the
reviews support in direction only.

Three numbers in circulation are routinely misread. The 2.3-3.1 band from Helms
is per kilogram of fat-free mass, so it is smaller than it looks when multiplied
by body weight. Morton's 2.2 is the edge of a confidence interval around a
plateau that did not reach statistical significance, from trials mostly at
energy balance; it is not a wall, least of all in a deficit. And the 0.4 and
0.55 g/kg per meal figures are a way to spread a daily target across four
meals, not a statement that a bigger meal is wasted.

Kidney disease is the one case that changes the answer: there the cut band is
withdrawn and the question goes to the treating clinician.

## 한국어 요약 (답변용)

- 감량 중인 근력운동인은 하루 단백질을 체중 1 kg당 최소 1.6 g 정도로 잡는다. 이 하한이 근거가
  가장 단단한 부분이다.
- 1.6-2.4 g/kg 사이에서는 연구가 숫자를 하나로 정해주지 않는다. 몸이 마를수록, 적자가 클수록
  위쪽으로 잡는 것은 방향만 뒷받침되는 판단이다.
- 흔히 보는 "2.3-3.1 g/kg"는 체중이 아니라 제지방량 기준이다. 체지방률을 모르면 이 숫자는 쓰지 않는다.
- "2.2 g/kg가 상한"은 연구가 말한 것이 아니다. 유의하지 않은 꺾임점의 신뢰구간 끝값이고, 감량
  시험들은 2.3-2.4 g/kg를 썼다.
- 끼니당 0.4-0.55 g/kg는 하루 목표를 네 끼에 나누는 계산이지, 그 이상 먹으면 버려진다는 뜻이 아니다.
- 신장 질환이 있으면 감량용 고단백 범위를 보여주지 않고 담당 의료진에게 넘긴다. 신장 기능이 정상인
  사람에게 1.6-2.4 g/kg가 해롭다는 근거는 찾지 못했고, 그렇다고 말하지도 않는다.
- 한국인 영양소 섭취기준의 단백질 권장량은 인구집단 적정 섭취 기준이다. 감량 중 훈련 목표를 대신하거나
  고쳐 주는 값으로 쓰지 않는다.
