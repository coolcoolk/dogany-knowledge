      Total daily protein scales with body weight (1.4-2.0 g/kg/day). RESCALE
      from the user's measured weight rather than quoting fixed grams. In a
      caloric deficit the target is owned by
      nutrition/protein-deficit-lean-mass-target-062 (1.6-2.4 g/kg body
      weight); the 2.3-3.1 band is per kg of FAT-FREE MASS and must never be
      multiplied by body weight.
    grade: A
claim: >
  Total daily protein intake of ~1.4-2.0 g/kg/day is sufficient for most
  exercising adults; the per-meal muscle-protein-synthesis response is maximized
  at ~0.25 g/kg body weight, or an absolute 20-40 g, per meal.
reasoning: >
  The ISSN 2017 protein stand aligns with the joint ACSM/AND/DC position
  (~1.2-2.0 g/kg/day) and the IOM Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range;
  no credible body disputes the intake range, and MacNaughton 2016 refines the
  per-meal figure inside it. Convergence across independent institutional bodies
  with no dispute reaches the top confidence band on the GRADE spine. This is the
  dose/absorption claim (nutrition-owned); the timing/anabolic-window claim is a
  separate exercise-owned item.

# nutrition/protein-intake-002

The daily-intake range and the per-meal dose are the two load-bearing numbers.
Both are corroborated across independent institutional bodies with no credible
dispute, so the claim sits at the top of the confidence ladder.

The daily figure scales with the user's body weight; the answer path RESCALES
from a measured weight rather than reciting the fixed grams. Lean-mass retention
during a caloric deficit is a separate target owned by
nutrition/protein-deficit-lean-mass-target-062; the 2.3-3.1 figure often quoted
for it is per kilogram of fat-free mass, not body weight. Protein timing (the anabolic window) is a
separate, exercise-owned claim and is deliberately not decided here.
