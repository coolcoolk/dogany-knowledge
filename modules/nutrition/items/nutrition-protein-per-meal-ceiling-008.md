# Authored 2026-09-02 (nutrition-lane collection sprint, v11). This item exists
# to hold a LIVE DISPUTE against an already-shipped item: the per-meal ceiling
# in nutrition/protein-intake-002 was directly challenged by a 2023 tracer trial
# and the challenge is itself disputed in print. Neither side is laundered.
# Item 002 keeps ownership of the daily-intake range; this item owns the ceiling
# dispute only.
# Source re-audit 2026-10-07: Trommelen 2023 re-read at the Europe PMC full text
# (36 men, 12 per arm of placebo, 25 g or 100 g, so the body's "either 25 or 100
# g" omitted the placebo arm; fixed). The Witard and Mettler comment and the
# Trommelen reply were NOT re-read (publisher pages return 403); only the reply's
# title ("Protein Intake Distribution: Beneficial, Detrimental, or Inconsequential
# for Muscle Anabolism?") was checked at PubMed, so the dispute is carried as
# summarised at authoring. Apicella 2025 (young females, 15 vs 20 g whey) and
# MacNaughton 2016 (trained men, 40 g beat 20 g) added to the population note.
# Letter and contested flag unchanged.

      POPULATION BOUND, and it is narrow. The trial enrolled 36 healthy,
      recreationally active young men aged 18-40, 12 per arm (placebo, 25 g,
      100 g). The published counter-comment states explicitly that these
      participants were recreationally active but NOT resistance-trained, and
      that the no-upper-limit reading does not appear to translate to
      resistance-trained young women. In trained men a 20 g maximum was already
      exceeded at 40 g after whole-body lifting (MacNaughton 2016, n=30), which
      is why the planning figure is stated as 20-40 g; no trial in trained
      people tested a dose near 100 g. The one later trial in young women
      (Apicella 2025, 28 women) found 15 g and 20 g of whey gave the same
      post-exercise synthesis, which says nothing about doses above 20 g. Do not
      speak this finding to a trained user, or to a woman, as if it were
      established for them.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      DO NOT INVERT THIS INTO ADVICE. That a 100 g bolus produces a larger and
      longer anabolic response than 25 g is a mechanistic measurement over 12
      hours. No trial has shown that eating protein in large infrequent boluses
      produces more muscle over a training block than the same daily total spread
      out. The measured endpoint is protein synthesis, not accrued muscle.
    grade: B
claim: >
  The long-standing per-meal anabolic ceiling (about 0.25 g/kg body weight, or
  20-40 g absolute) is contested rather than settled. A quadruple-tracer
  feeding-infusion trial in 36 healthy recreationally active young men (12 per
  arm, including a placebo arm) found that 100 g of protein after resistance
  exercise produced a greater and longer (beyond 12 hours) anabolic response
  than 25 g, with a dose-response rise in amino acid availability and
  incorporation into muscle protein and negligible change in breakdown or
  oxidation rates. The authors conclude the response has no upper limit in
  magnitude or duration. A published counter-comment accepts
  the measurement but disputes the practical reading and states the result does
  not appear to extend to resistance-trained young women.
reasoning: >
  This is a single, methodologically strong, mechanistically deep trial that
  contradicts a figure this warehouse already ships at the top confidence band.
  The lane's own rules forbid both available shortcuts: it cannot be dismissed
  (the tracer methodology is stronger than what established the ceiling) and it
  cannot promote itself over a converged position (one trial, n=36, one narrow
  population, and a live printed dispute between the authors and independent
  commentators). It therefore sits at the RCT-level pre-consensus band with a
  contested flag, and the resolution is deliberately withheld rather than guessed.
  What survives for a consumer is narrow and it is a DE-ESCALATION, not a new
  target: there is no evidential basis for warning a user that protein above
  roughly 40 g in one sitting is wasted. That warning was never well founded and
  is now directly contradicted. It does not follow that large boluses are better,
  because no study has taken this to a muscle-mass endpoint over a training block.

# nutrition/protein-per-meal-ceiling-008

The familiar rule that a single meal can only use twenty to forty grams of
protein for muscle-building is under real challenge. A tracer study using four
simultaneous isotope labels followed thirty-six young men for over twelve hours
after they drank a placebo, twenty-five grams or one hundred grams of protein
following resistance exercise (twelve men per drink), and found the larger dose
produced a bigger and much longer anabolic response with essentially no increase
in oxidation or breakdown. The authors state flatly that the response has no
upper limit.

That is not the end of the argument, and this item deliberately does not end it.
An independent published comment accepts the measurement while objecting to how
it has been read, and adds that the participants were recreationally active
rather than resistance-trained and that the finding does not appear to hold for
resistance-trained young women. The original authors replied in print. The
dispute is live, so the claim is held one step below the top of the confidence
ladder and carries a contested flag.

What actually changes for someone logging meals is smaller than the headline
suggests, and it points toward relaxing a rule rather than adopting a new one.
There is no longer a defensible basis for telling a user that protein beyond a
per-meal threshold is wasted. There is equally no basis for telling them to eat
in large infrequent boluses, because the studied endpoint is protein synthesis
measured over hours, not muscle measured over months. The daily-total claim is
owned by a separate item and is not disturbed here.
