      Generalizability limit. The strongest evidence (volume-equated,
      direct-imaging RCTs: Longo 2022; 2025 Sport Sci Health) is ALL single-joint
      unilateral knee extension, small-n (17-28), mostly untrained young men,
      8-10 weeks. So "rest duration per se is neutral once volume-load is
      equated" is well-demonstrated for ISOLATION + hypertrophy and is an
      extrapolation to heavy multi-joint compounds and to trained strength
      athletes. No direct head-to-head compound-vs-isolation rest trial exists.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      Magnitude/plateau caution. The hypertrophy edge for >60s rest is small
      with credible intervals crossing zero (Singer 2024: thigh SMD 0.17 CrI
      -0.13..0.43; arm 0.13 CrI -0.27..0.51). The ">90s confers no further
      benefit" plateau is LOW-certainty (authors call it equivocal). Do not
      present rest length as a strong hypertrophy lever.
    grade: D
  - note: >
      The older "short rest -> more metabolic stress -> more hypertrophy"
      hypothesis is NOT supported. The competing "short rest -> more muscle
      damage aids remodeling" chain (Senna 2022) is contested and measured only
      surrogate markers (RPE, CK/LDH), not hypertrophy. Treat short-rest-for-
      growth as unsupported, not merely weaker.
    grade: D
claim: >
  Inter-set rest affects hypertrophy and maximal strength PRIMARILY by
  preserving per-set volume-load (reps x load); when volume-load is equated,
  rest duration per se has little independent effect on either outcome. Short
  rest hurts only by cutting reps on later sets, which lowers total volume.
  Practical direction: heavy multi-joint STRENGTH work needs longer rest
  (>2 min to MAXIMIZE strength in resistance-trained lifters; 60-120 s adequate
  for untrained) to hold load across sets; isolation / hypertrophy work
  tolerates shorter rest (~60-90 s) PROVIDED reps are preserved; sub-60 s rest
  is acceptable only if extra sets restore total volume. Heavier / closer-to-
  failure sets accumulate more fatigue per set, so they practically require more
  rest to preserve the next set's load.
reasoning: >
  Grgic et al. 2018 (Sports Medicine 48(1):137-151, PMID 28933024), a systematic
  review of 23 studies / 491 participants, concludes robust strength gains occur
  even with <60 s rest but >2 min is required to MAXIMIZE strength in trained
  lifters (60-120 s sufficient untrained) -- the best-supported, direction-clear
  claim (grade B). For hypertrophy, the mechanism is volume-load, shown directly
  by volume-equated RCTs: Longo et al. 2022 (JSCR 36(6):1554-1559, PMID 35622106,
  n=28 unilateral knee-ext, quad CSA) found long-rest and volume-matched
  short-rest both grew ~13% vs ~7% for standard 1-min and volume-cut long-rest,
  with equal 1RM across all -- "greater volume-load plays the primary role,
  regardless of interset rest"; replicated by a 2025 MRI study (20 s vs 2 min
  equal rectus femoris CSA once reps matched). The Singer/Coleman 2024 Bayesian
  meta (9 RCTs) finds only a small, uncertain hypertrophy edge to >60 s
  (credible intervals cross zero), attributed to volume-load preservation. The
  origin trial (Schoenfeld 2016, trained men, 1 vs 3 min) found longer rest
  better for both strength and hypertrophy, but its hypertrophy magnitude did
  NOT replicate in the metas once volume was accounted for. Senna 2022 shows
  short rest raises RPE and damage markers from set 3, explaining why heavy
  work needs longer rest to hold load. Generalizability is the main caveat (see
  refraction_notes): direct evidence is isolation/untrained/short-duration, so
  the compound + trained-strength application is a reasoned extrapolation, not a
  directly observed result.

# exercise/rest-interval-volume-load-017

How long you rest between sets is not itself a growth or strength lever -- it
matters almost entirely through one downstream thing: whether you can still hit
your reps on the next set. Rest long enough and you keep your reps and load, so
your total working volume stays high; cut rest too short and later sets lose
reps, and it is that lost volume, not the short rest, that costs you. In trials
that deliberately matched total volume, 20-60 second rest and 2-3 minute rest
produced the same muscle growth and the same strength.

The practical read: heavy multi-joint strength work (squat, deadlift, press,
row) wants roughly 2-3 minutes -- over 2 minutes to fully maximize strength in a
trained lifter -- because that is what it takes to hold the load across sets.
Single-joint / isolation work tolerates shorter rest (about 60-90 seconds) as
long as the reps hold up. Going under a minute is only fine if you add sets to
make the total reps back up. Heavier or closer-to-failure sets fatigue you more
per set, so they earn more rest.

Honest limits: the cleanest evidence (volume-matched, scanned) is all
single-joint leg extension in small, mostly untrained groups over 8-10 weeks, so
applying it to heavy barbell compounds and to trained strength athletes is a
reasonable extrapolation rather than a directly measured fact. The hypertrophy
difference from rest is small and uncertain either way, and the old "short rest
grows more muscle" idea is not supported.
