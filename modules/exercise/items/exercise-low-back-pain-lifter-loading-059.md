# Injury-caution sprint follow-up 2026-10-06 (GAPS.md v36: "low-back pain has
# no loading row in this warehouse ... deserves its own row"). The low back /
# pelvis is the commonest injury site in powerlifting and among the top sites
# in weightlifting (Tung 2024), yet 056 has no tissue for it, so any present
# back pain falls to current-other (close the site, triage). For non-specific
# back pain the trial and guideline evidence says the opposite default: stay
# active, keep exercising, and keep loading the hinge at a dose the back
# tolerates. This row says where low-back pain sits on the 056 ladder, which
# lifts change first, and which cues are red flags. Population caveat up
# front: the treatment evidence is general-population (primary-care) back
# pain plus one small Swedish deadlift trial; no trial in competitive lifters.
#
# ladder_mapping, modify_order and red_flags are structured data for the
# split / caution code (site key lower_back; see
# the caution-ladder field guide (not public), Rule 7). Values are DIRECTIONS and
# ORDERINGS, never loads in kilograms and never risk figures.

refraction_notes:
  - note: >
      REST IS NOT THE TREATMENT. For acute back pain, advice to stay active
      gave small gains in pain and function over advice to rest in bed; for
      chronic non-specific back pain, exercise cut pain by about 15 points
      out of 100 against no treatment. Guidelines put activity and exercise
      first. So a familiar back ache without red flags changes how the lifter
      trains, not whether they train. For sciatica-type leg pain, the review
      found little difference either way; that picture goes to triage first.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      THE DEADLIFT IS A TREATMENT OPTION, NOT A BANNED LIFT. In recurrent
      mechanical back pain, a supervised deadlift programme improved pain,
      strength and endurance and matched individualised low-load motor
      control at 2, 12 and 24 months (motor control did better on the
      patients' own activity goals at 2 months). Who did best on the
      deadlift: lower pain, lower disability, better back-extensor
      endurance. So with higher pain or poor back endurance, start the hinge
      lighter, or from low-load control work, and build up. One trial of 70,
      with physio supervision.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      DO NOT SELL "NEVER ROUND YOUR BACK" AS INJURY PREVENTION. Low-quality
      evidence finds that more lumbar flexion while lifting is not a risk
      factor for back pain starting or persisting. Technique cues are fine as
      performance and load-control cues; they are not the claim that a
      rounded rep caused or will cause the pain. Modify by load, range and
      variant (modify_order), not by chasing a posture.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      CHANGE THE HEAVIEST AXIAL LIFT FIRST, THEN THE RANGE, THEN THE VARIANT.
      Lifters attribute back-and-other injuries to the squat about as often
      as to the deadlift, and most injured powerlifters keep training by
      cutting volume or intensity or dropping certain exercises; few stop
      completely. That is the order modify_order encodes: load and effort,
      then range or lever, then a lower-axial swap, then spread across the
      week, with exposure cut only at the triage rungs. This is practitioner
      synthesis plus descriptive survey data, not a trial that ranks options.
    grade: D
  - note: >
      THE PAIN CEILING IS BORROWED. The 055 rule (about 5/10 during and after,
      back to usual by next morning, not rising week to week) was tested on
      the Achilles; using it for the low back is by analogy. Exercise into
      some pain was not worse than pain-free exercise in a meta-analysis that
      included chronic back pain, which supports a ceiling over zero pain,
      but no back trial tested this exact rule.
    grade: D
  - note: >
      AFTER AN EPISODE, EXPECT IT BACK. About two thirds of people recovered
      from back pain had another episode within 12 months (40% activity-
      limiting); more than two previous episodes predicted recurrence.
      Exercise with education cut the risk of a new episode by about 45%;
      back belts did not prevent back pain in the (occupational) trials.
      So a recovered back stays history-recent for the product window, keeps
      its prep and trunk endurance work, and repeated episodes do not decay
      to history-old. Whether a lifting belt changes back-pain risk in
      lifters was not studied.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      RED FLAGS ARE A CLUSTER, NOT A CHECKLIST SCORE. Most single red flags
      have weak diagnostic accuracy; older age, steroids, trauma and bruising
      raise fracture likelihood, and a cancer history is the strongest
      malignancy flag. Cauda-equina cues (saddle numbness, bladder or bowel
      change, both legs weak or numb) override everything and are same-day.
      The engine names the cue and routes; it never rules a red flag out.
    grade: D
claim: >
  Low-back pain in a lifter is placed on the 056 ladder by its picture, not
  by the site alone. A familiar, non-specific back ache or stiffness without
  leg symptoms or red flags maps to current-load-pain: keep training, keep
  hinging at a tolerated dose under the borrowed 055 pain ceiling, and change
  the heaviest axial lifts first (load and effort, then range or lever, then a
  lower-axial swap, then spread the remaining hinge and squat work across the
  week). A new sharp episode that stops the lifter hinging an empty bar, or
  pain spreading below the knee, maps to current-other: stay active, no heavy
  hinge or loaded squat, triage the leg symptoms, no bed rest. Saddle
  numbness, bladder or bowel change, progressive leg weakness, trauma or
  osteoporosis, cancer history, night pain or fever are red flags and are
  referred; cauda-equina cues the same day. Staying active beats bed rest,
  exercise treats chronic back pain, a supervised deadlift programme worked
  as well as low-load motor control, flexion while lifting has not been
  shown to cause back pain, about two thirds of recovered backs flare again
  within a year, and exercise with education lowers that risk. The ladder
  mapping and the modify-first order are practitioner synthesis; no trial in
  lifters ranks them.
reasoning: >
  Without this row, 056 has no tissue for the lower back and every present
  back pain falls to current-other, which closes the site. That is the
  bed-rest default the back-pain evidence argues against. Dahm 2010 and
  Hayden 2021 carry the stay-active and exercise direction at moderate
  certainty in general populations, and Foster 2018 shows guidelines agree.
  The lifter-specific piece is thin: Aasa 2015 / Michaelson 2016 is one
  70-person trial showing a deadlift programme is a legitimate treatment, and
  Berglund 2015 says who is more likely to benefit (lower pain, better back
  endurance), which is why the high-pain picture starts lighter instead of
  being barred. Saraceni 2020 removes the flexion-causes-pain premise behind
  many technique-based bans, at low quality. Tung 2024, Stromback 2018 and
  Bengtsson 2018 are descriptive: the low back is the commonest powerlifting
  site, lifters mostly modify rather than stop, and the squat is implicated
  as often as the deadlift, so the modify order targets heavy axial loading
  in general, not the deadlift alone. da Silva 2019 and Steffens 2016 justify
  keeping a recovered back on history-recent with endurance work. The red
  flags follow the IFOMPT framework (Finucane 2020) with Downie 2013's
  accuracy caveat. The axis is hard with block_specifics: until the user's
  words place the back pain in one picture, the specific modify steps and the
  ceiling are withheld and the triage route applies.

# exercise/low-back-pain-lifter-loading-059 -- 허리가 아픈데 운동해도 되나, 데드리프트는

**한 줄 그림:** 익숙한 허리 통증이고 위험 신호가 없으면 쉬지 말고 계속 운동한다. 가장 무거운
데드리프트·스쿼트부터 무게, 범위, 동작 순서로 바꾼다. 다리로 뻗치는 통증이나 위험 신호가 있으면
먼저 확인부터 한다.

## Where the low back sits on the 056 ladder

| Picture (user's words) | 056 rung | What changes |
|---|---|---|
| familiar ache / stiffness, no leg symptoms, no red flag | current-load-pain | keep training; modify_order steps 1-4; 055 ceiling by analogy |
| new sharp episode, cannot hinge an empty bar | current-other | stay active; no heavy hinge / loaded squat until bending is tolerable; no bed rest |
| pain or tingling below the knee | current-other | pain-triage before heavy axial loading |
| any red-flag cue | red-flag | stop the site, refer; cauda-equina cues same day |
| recovered, last episode inside the product window | history-recent | keep the lifts, add back-extensor / trunk endurance |
| recovered longer ago | history-old | history-recent instead if more than two past episodes |

## Modify first (in this order)

1. Load and effort on the heaviest axial hinge and squat (fewer top sets, more reps in reserve, controlled tempo).
2. Range or lever (block / rack pull, trap bar, Romanian deadlift to tolerance, box or front squat).
3. Lower-axial swap (hip thrust, back extension at tolerance, split squat, machine-supported leg work), hinge pattern kept light.
4. Spread the remaining hinge and squat work across the week; cut exposure days only at current-other or red-flag.

Always: keep upper body, walking and non-provoking work; add trunk and back-extensor endurance; step back up as the ceiling holds.

## 한국어 요약 (답변용)

- 허리가 아프다고 쉬는 게 치료는 아니다. 급성 허리 통증에서 침대에서 쉬라는 조언보다 평소처럼
  움직이라는 조언이 통증과 일상 기능에서 조금 나았다. 만성 허리 통증에는 운동이 통증을 100점 중
  15점쯤 줄였다.
- 익숙한 허리 통증이고, 무릎 아래로 뻗치는 증상이나 위험 신호가 없으면 계속 운동한다. 대신 가장
  무거운 데드리프트·스쿼트부터 바꾼다. 먼저 무게와 강도를 낮추고, 그래도 아프면 범위나 동작
  (블록 풀, 트랩바, 루마니안 데드리프트, 박스·프론트 스쿼트)을 바꾸고, 그다음 허리에 덜 실리는
  동작(힙 쓰러스트, 백 익스텐션, 스플릿 스쿼트, 머신)으로 바꾼다. 남은 힌지·스쿼트는 주 안에 나눈다.
- 통증 기준은 힘줄 규칙(055)을 빌려 쓴다. 운동 중·후 10점 중 5점까지, 다음 날 아침엔 평소대로,
  주마다 늘지 않을 것. 다만 허리에서 직접 시험된 기준은 아니다.
- 데드리프트는 금지 동작이 아니라 치료로도 쓰인다. 허리가 반복해서 아픈 사람에게 감독하에 데드리프트를
  시킨 연구에서 통증·근력·지구력이 좋아졌고, 2년 뒤까지 저부하 조절 운동과 차이가 없었다. 통증이
  낮고 허리 버티는 힘이 좋은 사람이 더 잘 맞았다. 통증이 크면 가볍게 시작해서 올린다.
- 들 때 허리가 조금 굽는 것이 허리 통증의 원인이라는 근거는 없다(질 낮은 근거). 자세 교정은
  수행·부하 조절용 큐로 쓰고, "허리를 굽히면 다친다"고 말하지 않는다.
- 갑자기 날카롭게 아파서 빈 봉도 못 들 정도면 무거운 힌지와 스쿼트는 잠시 빼고, 걷기와 상체 운동
  같은 다른 움직임은 이어간다. 침대에 눕는 게 아니다. 무릎 아래로 저리거나 뻗치면 먼저 확인한다.
- 위험 신호: 사타구니·엉덩이 감각 이상, 소변·대변 조절 이상, 다리 힘 빠짐이나 양쪽 저림이
  심해짐(이 셋은 당일 진료), 넘어지거나 부딪힌 뒤 통증, 골다공증·장기 스테로이드·고령, 암 병력,
  이유 없는 체중 감소, 쉬어도 안 가라앉는 밤 통증, 열·감염. 이런 경우 운동이 아니라 진료로 보낸다.
- 나은 뒤에도 1년 안에 셋 중 둘은 다시 아프다. 운동과 교육을 같이 하면 재발 위험이 절반 가까이
  준다. 그래서 회복 후에도 허리 지구력 운동을 유지하고, 여러 번 반복된 허리는 오래된 이력으로
  내리지 않는다.
- 단계 배치와 바꾸는 순서는 실무 판단이다. 역도·파워리프팅 선수를 대상으로 순서를 비교한 연구는 없다.
