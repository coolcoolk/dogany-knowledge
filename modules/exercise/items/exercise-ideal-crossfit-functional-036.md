# Body-ideal archetype sprint 2026-09-30. A second named ideal
# ("크로스핏 기능성"). The kit already reads it as work capacity (intervals,
# power, mixed-modal circuits) after a 2026-09-29 correction;
# this row supplies the source for that reading and the measurement map.

      FUNCTIONAL HERE MEANS WORK CAPACITY, NOT BALANCE OR COORDINATION. The
      method's own definition is output across broad time and modal domains:
      short and long efforts, lifting, gymnastics and monostructural cardio.
      One-side balance and body linking belong to the connection side (Pilates,
      exercise/ideal-pilates-controlled-movement-037); offering them as "기능성" was the error a user
      corrected on 2026-09-29.
    grade: A
  - note: >
      THE RISK IS SUPERVISION AND FATIGUE, NOT THE BRAND. Pooled incidence sits
      with weightlifting and powerlifting; the reported risk factors are prior
      injury, lack of coach supervision and competition. Shoulder work under
      fatigue (kipping, ring muscle-ups, overhead lifts) is where the shoulder
      share comes from.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      THE OUTCOME LITERATURE IS THIN. The one systematic review with a
      meta-analysis found few low-bias studies and no significant pooled
      effects; do not promise the method outperforms ordinary concurrent
      training.
    grade: C
claim: >
  CrossFit-type functional fitness defines the goal as work capacity across
  broad time and modal domains: being good at many things at once -- strength,
  power, stamina, cardiorespiratory endurance, gymnastic bodyweight skill,
  speed, agility, balance, coordination, accuracy, flexibility -- trained by
  constantly varied mixed-modal workouts at high relative intensity. The body
  it produces is a lean, muscular, all-round one whose defining feature is what
  it can DO, measured by times, loads, reps and rounds, not by a shape. Its
  injury incidence is similar to weightlifting and powerlifting, concentrated
  in shoulder, spine and knee, with prior injury, lack of supervision and
  competition as the named risk factors.
reasoning: >
  The definition is the method's own foundational text, so it carries the rule
  grade as a definition of the ideal (not as a claim that the method works).
  The injury picture comes from two systematic reviews that agree on the site
  distribution and on comparability with other strength sports. Performance
  determinants (muscle size, a high aerobic threshold, rate of force
  development) come from a small observational study and are graded
  accordingly.

# exercise/ideal-crossfit-functional-036 -- 크로스핏 / 기능성 체력

**한 줄 그림:** 무겁게 들고, 빨리 움직이고, 숨이 차도 오래 버티는 -- 무엇이든 잘 해내는 다재다능한
몸. 모양보다 "해내는 능력"이 기준.

## Distinguishing features

- Breadth, not a peak: the target is no big gap across strength, power,
  conditioning and bodyweight skill.
- Mixed-modal and time-bound: work is scored as time, rounds, reps or load.
- Neighbours: powerlifting / weightlifting = one peak (max load, max power);
  endurance = one long-duration peak; Pilates/yoga = control and range, not
  output.

## Measurable here

- `e1rm_<lift>` for a squat/hinge/press (strength leg of the triangle).
- `max_reps_<lift>` for a bodyweight skill (pull-up, push-up) -- the gymnastics
  leg.
- `weekly_sessions`; workouts `minutes` / `kcal` / `avg_hr` for conditioning
  sessions (readable, not a strand token).
- `body_fat_pct`, `skeletal_muscle_kg` -- secondary (they predict performance,
  they are not the goal).
- Practice picks the program acts on: `power`, `mixed_circuit`, `conditioning`.

## Not measurable here

Benchmark workout times (e.g. a named WOD), row/run/bike pace or distance,
jump height, rounds completed in a circuit, VO2max. None has a token; the
workouts table stores minutes and kcal only. A logged benchmark time would need
a new metric (proposed `benchmark_time_s_<name>`).

## Training emphasis and practice

Concurrent strength + conditioning + skill: a lead strength lift, short
interval work, a mixed circuit 1-2x/week, low-dose power. Supervision and
technique before load under fatigue.

## Failure modes

Shoulder overload from high-rep overhead/kipping work under fatigue; spine
under fatigued lifting; returning with a previous injury; competition
intensity without coaching.

## Combines / conflicts

- With classic physique: compatible at moderate conditioning doses; heavy
  running volume costs a little fibre growth (042). Body composition helps
  performance, so the strands mostly pull together.
- With Pilates: complementary -- Pilates brings controlled range and trunk
  control that high-intensity work under fatigue tends to erode.
- With powerlifting: overlapping but diluted -- breadth caps the peak.
