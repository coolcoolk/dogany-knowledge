    note: the effective programmes combined cuff and scapular work; a scapula-only focus was no better than general exercise after 6 weeks (Bury 2016)
refraction_notes:
  - note: >
      THE PREVENTION DOSE IS SMALL AND IT IS IN THE WARM-UP. The two trials
      that cut shoulder problems in overhead athletes ran a short band and
      bodyweight programme three times a week as part of the warm-up, about
      3 sets of 8-16 per exercise, changing exercises every six weeks and
      progressing by reps, then band stiffness, then a small weight.
      Shoulder-problem prevalence fell from 23% to 17% in one; the injury
      rate fell by about half in the other. These were handball players, not
      lifters; the direction is carried, the size is not.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      FOR A PAINFUL CUFF, RESISTED AND PROGRESSED IS WHAT WORKED. In
      persistent subacromial pain, cuff plus scapular strengthening (3 x 15,
      load set so pain stayed at or under 5/10 and settled before the next
      session) beat unspecific exercise and cut the share choosing surgery
      from 63% to 20%. Across trials, progressive resisted exercise helped and
      unresisted, non-progressed drills did not, and caused more flares.
      "Only ever a pink dumbbell" is folklore; the load is set by the pain
      ceiling, not by a weight cap.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      MORE IS NOT SHOWN TO BE BETTER. The only review of higher vs lower
      dose in rotator-cuff tendinopathy found three small trials with
      conflicting, low to very low certainty results. The twice-daily rehab
      dose is the dose that was TESTED, not the dose shown to be NEEDED. The
      composer may offer it as optional home work but should not make daily
      cuff work a requirement of the plan.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      THE MECHANISM IS UNPROVEN, THE OUTCOME IS NOT. Weaker external
      rotation and scapular dyskinesis predict later shoulder problems in
      athletes (dyskinesis RR 1.43), and lifters with impingement have
      weaker external rotators and lower trapezius. But the programme that
      cut shoulder problems did not change external-rotation strength or
      internal-rotation range. Say "this routine lowered shoulder problems",
      never "this fixes your imbalance" or "your ratio is now safe".
    grade: C
  - note: >
      PLACEMENT. Light, sub-failure prep before pressing is the tested form.
      Anything taken close to failure on the cuff belongs after the main
      pressing and overhead lifts (or on a day without them): a fatigued
      cuff let the humeral head ride up in a lab study. No trial tests
      placement in lifters; this is a cautious default, not a finding.
    grade: D
  - note: >
      FOLKLORE WITH NO TRIAL BEHIND IT. A fixed pull-to-push set ratio
      (2:1, 3:1); "face pulls prevent shoulder injury" (no trial of face
      pulls as prevention); "the best lower-trap exercise" picked from EMG
      rankings (EMG amplitude is not an outcome, see 013); "fix the scapula
      first" (scapula-only focus was not better beyond 6 weeks). The composer
      should not justify any choice with these.
    grade: C
claim: >
  For a lifter with a shoulder caution, add a small amount of
  external-rotation plus scapular (lower-trapezius, serratus) work, sized by
  the 056 rung. No caution, mild, or old history: 1-2 light band or cable
  drills, 2-3 sets of 8-16, in the warm-up of sessions that load the
  shoulder, aiming at about three times a week, progressed by reps then
  resistance and rotated about every six weeks -- the shape of the handball
  programmes that cut shoulder problems (OR 0.72; HRR 0.44). Recent or
  undated history: both families in prep every shoulder session, plus one
  resisted external-rotation or lower-trap accessory after the main lifts
  twice a week. Present rotator-cuff-type pain without red flags: 2-3
  resisted cuff and scapular exercises of 3 x 10-15, load set by the 055
  pain ceiling and progressed, reviewed at 12 weeks, after the protocol
  that beat unspecific exercise and reduced surgery; the tested twice-daily
  home dose is optional because no dose has been shown to be needed.
  Present joint, instability or unknown pain, or red flags: no prehab
  prescription until triage. Keep fatiguing cuff work after pressing.
  Pull-push ratios, face-pull-as-prevention and EMG-ranked "best" drills
  have no outcome trial.
reasoning: >
  Prevention numbers come from the OSTRC programme sheet itself (read in
  full) and the Andersson 2017 cluster RCT, backed by Asker 2022's larger
  effect in adolescents; both are overhead-throwing populations, so the
  letter for lifters is dropped to C and the specific numbers are labelled
  as transported. Treatment numbers come from Holmgren 2012 at full text,
  whose load rule is the same pain-monitoring model 055 carries -- the
  shoulder trial used it as the load-setting method, it did not test it.
  Naunton 2020 supplies resisted-and-progressed over unresisted; Malliaras
  2020 supplies the absence of any shown dose-response, which is why the
  twice-daily rehab dose is optional and the in-gym dose is three times a
  week. Bury 2016 and Fredriksen 2020 keep the copy honest about mechanism.
  The placement rule rests on a lab mechanism (Chopp 2010) and stays at the
  practitioner floor. The history row is product judgement joining the
  prevention dose to a resisted accessory. The axis is hard with
  block_specifics because the rung (in particular whether present pain is
  cuff-type or a red flag) decides whether any dose is given at all.

# exercise/shoulder-prehab-dose-074 -- 어깨 주의가 있는 사람의 외회전·하부승모근·견갑 운동 양

**한 줄 그림:** 어깨 보강 운동은 많이 할수록 좋은 게 아니다. 워밍업에 가볍게 몇 세트, 주 3회 정도가
연구로 확인된 모양이다. 지금 회전근개 쪽이 아프면 통증 기준 안에서 무게를 올려 가며 한다.

## Dose by rung (engine-readable copy of `shoulder_prehab`)

| Context (056 rungs) | Slot | Drills | Sets x reps | Per week | Load | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (no caution, mild, history-old) | prep | 1-2 (ER + scapular) | 2-3 x 8-16 | ~3 | light band/cable, sub-failure, rotate every 6 wk | OSTRC programme (handball) |
| history (recent, unknown) | prep + 1 accessory | 2 in prep; 1 after main lifts | prep 2-3 x 8-16; accessory 2-3 x 10-15 | prep ~3; accessory 2 | accessory loaded and progressed | OSTRC + Naunton 2020; product judgement |
| current-load-pain (cuff-type, no red flag) | prep + accessory | 2-3 (ER + scapular) | 3 x 10-15 | ~3 (home daily optional) | 055 pain ceiling, progress load | Holmgren 2012 protocol |
| closed (current-other, red-flag) | none | -- | -- | -- | -- | pain-triage (031) |

Placement: light prep before the first pressing or overhead lift; anything near
failure on the cuff after the main pressing lifts or on another day; always cuff
plus scapular, never scapular-only.

## Evidence vs folklore

| Claim | State |
|---|---|
| A short shoulder programme in the warm-up, 3x/week, lowers shoulder problems | Two cluster RCTs, overhead athletes |
| Resisted, progressed cuff work helps cuff-type pain; unresisted does not | RCT + low-certainty review |
| Twice-daily cuff work is needed | Tested in one rehab trial; no dose shown to be needed |
| Cuff work must stay very light forever | Not supported; load is set by the pain ceiling |
| The routine works by fixing ER strength or IR range | Not shown; the programme changed neither |
| A fixed pull:push ratio protects the shoulder | No trial |
| Face pulls prevent shoulder injury | No trial of face pulls as prevention |
| EMG ranking picks the best drill | EMG amplitude is not an outcome (013) |

## 한국어 요약 (답변용)

- 어깨에 주의가 없거나, 가끔 뻣뻣한 정도거나, 예전에 다쳤다가 나은 경우: 어깨를 쓰는 날 워밍업에
  밴드·케이블 외회전과 견갑(하부승모근·전거근) 운동을 1~2개, 2~3세트 8~16회 가볍게 넣는다. 주 3회
  정도면 된다. 횟수부터 늘리고, 그다음 밴드를 더 센 걸로, 그다음 작은 무게로 올린다. 6주마다 동작을
  바꿔 준다. 핸드볼 선수 연구에서 이런 루틴이 어깨 문제를 줄였다. 헬스 하는 사람 대상 연구는 아니라서
  방향만 가져오고 효과 크기는 그대로 옮기지 않는다.
- 최근(12개월 안) 다쳤거나 언제 다쳤는지 모르면: 워밍업에 외회전과 견갑 운동을 둘 다 넣고, 메인
  운동이 끝난 뒤 저항을 건 외회전이나 하부승모근 운동 하나를 2~3세트 10~15회, 주 2회 더한다. 이 조합은
  연구 결과를 이어 붙인 제품 규칙이다.
- 지금 회전근개 쪽이 아프고 위험 신호가 없으면: 외회전과 견갑 운동 2~3개를 3세트 10~15회 한다.
  무게는 통증 기준(운동 중 10점 중 5점까지, 다음 운동 전에 평소 수준으로 돌아옴)으로 정하고, 기준 안에
  있으면 조금씩 올린다. 저항 없이 같은 동작만 반복하는 건 효과가 없었고 오히려 더 자주 아팠다. 12주쯤
  지나면 다시 본다. 연구에서는 하루 두 번 했지만, 더 많이 한다고 낫다는 근거는 없으니 집에서 하는 건
  선택으로 둔다.
- 지금 아픈 곳이 관절이거나, 빠지는 느낌이 있거나, 어디가 아픈지 모르거나, 위험 신호가 있으면: 보강
  운동을 처방하지 않고 먼저 통증 확인으로 보낸다.
- 순서: 가벼운 준비 운동은 프레스·머리 위 운동 전에 한다. 실패 지점까지 가는 회전근개 운동은 메인
  프레스가 끝난 뒤나 다른 날에 한다. 회전근개가 지치면 위팔뼈 머리가 위로 뜬다는 실험 결과에서 나온
  조심스러운 기본값이고, 헬스 하는 사람으로 확인된 건 아니다.
- 이렇게 말하지 않는다: "당기기:밀기 2:1이어야 안전하다", "페이스 풀이 부상을 막는다", "근전도로 보면
  이 동작이 최고다", "불균형을 고쳤으니 이제 안전하다". 모두 결과로 확인된 적이 없다. 예방 루틴은
  외회전 근력이나 가동범위를 바꾸지 않았는데도 어깨 문제를 줄였다.
