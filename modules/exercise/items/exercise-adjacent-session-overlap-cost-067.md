# Adjacent-recovery sprint 2026-10-06. What
# overlap between BACK-TO-BACK sessions actually costs, split three ways:
# next-day performance (measured), long-term adaptation (measured, null when
# weekly volume is equated) and injury (not measured anywhere found). Extends
# exercise/recovery-kinetics-session-spacing-025 (which holds the
# per-muscle-group-clock rejection) from "what sets recovery" to "what a
# composer should charge for a consecutive-day overlap", by overlap TYPE:
# same primary pattern, secondary mover only, squat <-> hinge (axial / hip
# extensor), grip, and upper vs lower.
#
# adjacent_overlap is structured data for the split / program composer (field
# guide: the adjacent-overlap field guide (not public)). Values are DIRECTIONS and
# ORDERINGS (cost_performance: high / moderate / low / none-measured /
# see-056; cost_when qualifies it). No penalty number
# here is a measurement; the composer's own weights stay product constants.

refraction_notes:
  - note: >
      THREE COSTS, NOT ONE. A back-to-back overlap has a next-day performance
      cost (measured: real after work to failure, small after work stopped
      short), a long-term adaptation cost (measured: none when weekly volume
      is the same -- six sessions a week matched three in trained men), and
      an injury cost (not measured in any lifter study found). Speak each
      separately; never let the measured performance cost stand in for an
      injury warning.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      EFFORT DECIDES THE PRICE. In the one trial that repeated the session
      itself, squat plus leg press to failure lost volume load when repeated
      24 h later and first-set load was still down at 48 h. Volume-matched
      work at about half the possible reps per set had velocity and jump
      back within about 6 h. So the same day-1 / day-2 muscle overlap is
      expensive after failure training and cheap after submaximal training.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      DEADLIFT DOES NOT NEED LONGER. The common belief that the deadlift
      needs more recovery than the squat failed a matched test in
      well-trained men (four sets to failure at 80%): no between-lift
      differences, and deadlift bar speed did not drop. Squat and deadlift
      fatigue do differ in shape (squat: larger, sooner; deadlift: smaller,
      longer-lasting braking-RFD loss), so a heavy squat day next to a heavy
      hinge day is a real lower-body adjacency, but not a special axial
      penalty.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      NO AXIAL-LOAD OR SPINE RECOVERY CLOCK WAS FOUND. No study located
      measures trunk-extensor or spinal recovery across 24-48 h after squats
      or deadlifts, or next-day hinge performance after a squat day (one
      university thesis appears to, and was not readable). The squat-hinge
      rule is a practitioner rule built from shared hip-extensor work.
    grade: D
  - note: >
      UPPER VERSUS LOWER IS CONTESTED. A 2024 review states the lower body
      needs 48-72 h and the upper body 24 h or less. The matched comparison
      found no between-lift difference, and after failure training bench
      velocity was still down at 48 h while squat velocity was back at 48 h
      in another trial. Do not schedule from body half.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      GRIP IS A SESSION LIMITER, NOT A SCHEDULE RULE. Grip fatigue limits
      pulling sets within a session, and straps reduce it. No next-day grip
      carry-over data were found, so the composer should not move days for
      grip.
    grade: D
  - note: >
      POPULATION. Every trial is young trained (mostly male) lifters over
      days to six weeks. Novices, older adults and women are extrapolation.
      Over a week of daily overreaching, 1RM and jump came back after three
      rest days, but jump reactivity did not. Whole-week fatigue is a
      different question from day-to-day overlap and is not settled here.
    grade: C
claim: >
  What overlap between back-to-back sessions costs depends on how hard the
  first session was, not on which muscle or body half was trained. Repeating
  a lower-body session to failure 24 h later lowers that session's volume, and
  first-set performance can stay down to 48 h. Work stopped well short of
  failure recovers within hours. Over six weeks, spreading the same weekly
  volume across six sessions, including the same lifts on consecutive days,
  gave the same strength and size gains as three sessions. Matched testing
  does not support the beliefs that the deadlift needs longer than the squat or
  that the upper body recovers faster than the lower body; one 2024 review
  states the second, so it is marked contested. A heavy squat day next to a
  heavy hinge day is still a lower-body adjacency, because both load the hip
  extensors, though no next-day cross-exercise trial was read. Grip and
  secondary-mover overlap have no measured next-day cost. No lifter study
  links back-to-back overlap to injury. For a composer, overlap should be
  charged by effort (to failure versus short of failure) and by pattern (same
  primary pattern, squat to hinge), with a caution site's spacing (056) taking
  precedence.
reasoning: >
  Goulart 2021 is the only design found that measures the second session
  itself at 24, 48 and 72 h. Its protocol was taken to failure, so it shows the
  high end of the cost. Morán-Navarro 2017 adds the effort contrast at matched
  volume in trained men. Pareja-Blanco 2020 repeats that contrast across ten
  set configurations. Item 025 attributed both to one paper; the re-audit of 025
  corrects this. Belcher 2019 is the only matched comparison of lifts. Gervasi
  2026 shows that squat and deadlift fatigue differ in shape. Colquhoun 2018 and
  Saric 2019 isolate frequency at equal weekly volume, and Colquhoun's 6x group
  squatted and benched on consecutive days. They are the strongest evidence that
  adjacency itself carries no adaptation cost; both ran six weeks in trained
  men. Keogh & Winwood 2017 gives low injury rates in weight-training sports and
  no spacing or frequency risk factor. Sousa 2024 states injury risk only
  through general muscle-damage reviews. The injury column is therefore "not
  measured" throughout, and the caution-site row defers to 056. Contested flag:
  the upper-versus-lower and deadlift-needs-longer conventions are widespread in
  coaching and in one 2024 review, and the matched data do not support them.

# exercise/adjacent-session-overlap-cost-067 -- 연달아 하는 날, 겹치면 무엇을 잃나

**한 줄 그림:** 이틀 연속 같은 근육을 쓰는 비용은 전날 얼마나 한계까지 갔느냐로 정해진다. 근육 부위나
상체·하체로 정해지지 않는다. 장기 성장 손해는 측정되지 않았고, 부상과의 관련은 연구된 적이 없다.

## The overlap table (engine-readable: `adjacent_overlap`)

| Overlap on consecutive days | Next-day performance | Long-term gains | Injury | Composer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| same primary mover, day 1 to failure | high (volume down at 24 h, first set to 48 h) | none if weekly volume equal | not measured | penalise; prefer 48 h |
| same primary mover, day 1 well short of failure | low (back within ~6 h in trial) | none if weekly volume equal | not measured | allow, charge less |
| secondary mover only | none measured | none measured | not measured | record, don't score |
| heavy squat day next to heavy hinge day | moderate if both heavy / near failure | none measured | not measured | lower-body adjacency; no extra deadlift penalty |
| heavy pulling (grip) | none measured next day | none measured | not measured | don't move days; straps |
| upper vs lower body | not a fixed order (contested) | -- | -- | don't use body half as a clock |
| caution site (056) | -- | -- | from 055/056 | 056 overrides |

The cost levels (high / moderate / low) are orderings. They are not
measurements, and the composer's weights stay product constants.

## 한국어 요약 (답변용)

- 이틀 연속 같은 근육을 주동근으로 쓸 때의 비용은 전날 강도에 달렸다. 실패 지점까지 간 하체 운동을
  24시간 뒤 똑같이 반복하면 그날 총 볼륨이 줄었다. 첫 세트 기록은 48시간까지 떨어져 있었다. 가능한 횟수의
  절반쯤에서 멈춘 운동은 몇 시간 만에 회복됐다.
- 주간 총량이 같으면 주 6회로 나눠 연달아 해도 주 3회와 근력·근육 증가가 같았다. 6주 동안 훈련된
  남성을 대상으로 한 연구들이고, 스쿼트와 벤치를 월요일부터 토요일까지 매일 한 그룹도 포함됐다.
- '데드리프트는 스쿼트보다 회복이 오래 걸린다'는 말은 같은 조건 비교에서 확인되지 않았다. 다만 스쿼트
  날과 힌지(데드리프트·RDL) 날을 붙이면 둘 다 엉덩이 신전근을 쓰므로 하체를 연달아 쓰는 날로 본다.
- '상체가 하체보다 빨리 회복된다'는 말은 근거가 엇갈린다. 2024년 리뷰는 그렇다고 하지만, 같은 조건
  비교에서는 차이가 없었다. 실패 지점까지 간 경우 벤치 속도가 스쿼트보다 늦게 돌아온 연구도 있다.
  상체·하체로 회복 시간을 정하지 않는다.
- 보조로만 쓰이는 근육(프레스할 때 삼두 등)과 악력이 겹치는 것은 다음 날 손해가 측정된 적이 없다.
  악력이 당기기 세트를 막으면 날짜를 옮기기보다 스트랩을 쓴다.
- 연달아 겹치는 날이 부상을 늘린다는 연구는 찾지 못했다. 부상 이력이 있거나 지금 아픈 부위는 주의
  단계(056)의 간격 규칙을 먼저 따른다.
