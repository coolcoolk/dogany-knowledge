# Injury-caution sprint follow-up 2026-10-06.
# Companion to 057: once the knee is on the knee variant of current-load-pain,
# WHICH depth, range and variant should the plan swap to. Also answers the
# healthy-knee question "is a deep squat bad for my knees". Evidence base is
# mostly biomechanical modelling in small samples of healthy people plus two
# small training trials, so this row is held at C / D. Machine / cable /
# dumbbell as categories have no knee-load comparison at all (GAPS.md).
#
# variant_swaps is structured data for the caution / exercise-selection code:
# ORDERINGS of patellofemoral load, never kilograms or risk figures.

refraction_notes:
  - note: >
      A DEEP SQUAT IS NOT BAD FOR A HEALTHY KNEE. In models and cadaver
      data, pressure behind the kneecap peaks around 90 degrees and falls
      again deeper, as the tendon wraps and the contact area grows. A review
      of more than 160 articles found the fear that deep squats cause
      cartilage damage or arthritis unfounded. For a knee without pain,
      depth is a training choice, not a caution.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      FOR A PAINFUL KNEE, CHANGE THE RANGE BEFORE CHANGING THE DAY. In a
      modelling study, squatting from standing to about 45 degrees and
      doing leg extensions from 90 to 45 degrees kept kneecap stress lowest;
      the squat is hardest on the kneecap deep, the leg extension near
      straight. So a knee on the knee variant of current-load-pain swaps to
      those ranges and works back toward full range one notch at a time
      under the 057 ceiling.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      THE SHALLOW SQUAT KEEPS THE QUADRICEPS GAIN. In a 10-week trial, half
      squats grew the thigh-front muscles as much as full squats; full squats
      grew the glutes and inner thigh more. A knee-friendly range costs
      little quadriceps stimulus; add hip work to cover the rest.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      "KNEES BEHIND THE TOES" MOVES THE LOAD, IT DOES NOT REMOVE IT. Blocking
      the knees from travelling forward cut knee torque by about a fifth but
      multiplied hip torque roughly tenfold, with more trunk lean. It is not
      a default squat cue, and it is a poor swap for anyone who also has a
      low-back caution.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      LUNGES AND STEP-UPS: LONG STEP, LOW STEP FIRST. A longer forward step
      puts less load behind the kneecap in deep flexion than a short one,
      and stepping up to a low platform less than lunging at ground level.
      The progression is shallow range, then moderate range, then deep to a
      low platform, then deep at ground level.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      MACHINE, CABLE OR DUMBBELL IS NOT ITSELF THE KNEE LEVER. No study
      compares knee pain or kneecap load between the same movement done with
      a machine, a cable, dumbbells or a barbell. What the evidence speaks to
      is knee angle, step length and hip-versus-knee bias. Machines are
      useful because a stop can fix the range and the load is easy to dial;
      that is a practical choice, not a measured knee benefit.
    grade: D
claim: >
  For a healthy knee, a deep squat has not been shown to harm cartilage:
  modelled pressure behind the kneecap peaks near 90 degrees and falls deeper.
  For a painful front of the knee, kneecap stress depends on knee angle and
  exercise type: squats and leg presses are hardest on the kneecap deep in
  flexion, leg extensions near straight, so the lowest-stress ranges are a
  squat from standing to about 45 degrees and a leg extension from 90 to 45
  degrees (variable-resistance machine lower than constant). A half squat
  grew the quadriceps as much as a full squat in a small trial, so a shallower
  range costs little quadriceps stimulus; hip-dominant work covers the glute
  and adductor gain and is part of the consensus treatment. Lunges load the
  kneecap less with a long step and when stepping to a low platform. Blocking
  the knees behind the toes shifts load to the hips and lower back rather than
  removing it. Machine, cable and dumbbell versions have not been compared for
  knee load; their value is that range and load are easy to control.
reasoning: >
  The PF stress curves (Powers 2014, Escamilla 1998, 2008, 2022) are model
  estimates from small healthy samples, consistent with each other on
  direction (closed chain hardest deep, open chain hardest near extension;
  lunge load rises with flexion), so they hold at C for the ordering and are
  indirect for a painful knee. Hartmann 2013 is a narrative review and
  itself notes no realistic force estimates beyond about 50 degrees in the
  deep squat; its "deep squats are safe" conclusion is carried for healthy
  knees only, and its claim that heavy partial squats favour degeneration is
  not carried as a rule because it is argument rather than data. Kubo 2019
  is the one located trial measuring what a shallower squat costs in muscle,
  in 17 men (training status not read); 014 explains why the quadriceps grow
  as a unit. Fry 2003 (7 men) is the reason the knee-behind-toes cue is not
  a default. The swap table's order and the machine / cable / dumbbell
  remarks are practitioner judgement built on those curves (D). The
  injury_history axis is soft with hedge: the healthy-knee note needs no
  history, and the swap rules are triggered by 057's placement, which
  carries the hard gate.

# exercise/knee-friendly-squat-depth-variants-058 -- 깊은 스쿼트는 무릎에 나쁜가, 무릎이 아프면 무엇으로 바꾸나

**한 줄 그림:** 아프지 않은 무릎에는 깊은 스쿼트가 해롭다는 근거가 없다. 무릎 앞쪽이 아프면 날을 빼지 말고
범위를 바꾼다. 스쿼트는 0-45도, 레그 익스텐션은 90-45도로 하고, 엉덩이 운동을 더한다.

## Variant swap order (engine-readable)

| Pattern | Kneecap load is highest | Knee-friendly swap | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| barbell back squat | near 90 deg / deep under load | squat to about 45 deg (box or pins), lower one notch at a time | model + small trial |
| leg press / hack / pendulum | near full flexion | machine stop at about 45-60 deg | practitioner |
| leg extension | 0-45 deg (near straight) | 90 -> 45 deg; cam (variable) machine over constant | model |
| lunge / split squat / step-up (dumbbells) | deep flexion, short step | long step, no stride; low platform before deep at ground | model |
| hip-dominant (RDL, hip thrust, cable pull-through, abduction) | low | keep or add in every swap set | consensus |
| knees blocked behind toes | -- | not a default; shifts load to hip and low back | small study |

Progression back to full range: one notch at a time, only after a week
inside the 057 knee ceiling.

## 한국어 요약 (답변용)

- 무릎이 아프지 않다면 깊은 스쿼트가 연골을 상하게 하거나 관절염을 만든다는 근거는 없다. 슬개골 뒤쪽
  압력은 90도 근처에서 가장 높고 그보다 깊이 앉으면 오히려 줄어든다는 계산 결과가 있다. 깊이는 훈련
  목적에 따라 고르면 된다.
- 무릎 앞쪽이 아프면 운동하는 날을 빼지 말고 범위를 바꾼다. 스쿼트는 서 있는 자세에서 45도 정도까지,
  레그 익스텐션은 90도에서 45도까지 하는 게 슬개골 부담이 가장 적었다. 스쿼트는 깊을수록, 레그
  익스텐션은 다리를 다 펼수록 부담이 커진다.
- 하프 스쿼트도 허벅지 앞 근육은 풀 스쿼트만큼 컸다(10주, 17명). 엉덩이와 안쪽 허벅지는 풀 스쿼트가 더
  컸으니 루마니안 데드리프트, 힙 쓰러스트, 케이블 풀스루, 힙 어브덕션 같은 엉덩이 운동을 더한다. 엉덩이와
  무릎을 같이 강화하는 게 무릎 앞쪽 통증의 권장 치료이기도 하다.
- 런지와 스플릿 스쿼트는 보폭을 길게 하고, 깊게 내려가기 전에 낮은 단(10cm 정도)에 올라서는 동작부터
  한다. 얕은 범위 → 중간 범위 → 낮은 단으로 깊게 → 바닥에서 깊게 순서로 올린다.
- "무릎이 발끝을 넘으면 안 된다"는 규칙은 부담을 없애는 게 아니라 엉덩이와 허리로 옮긴다. 한 연구에서
  무릎 부담은 5분의 1쯤 줄었지만 엉덩이 부담은 약 10배가 됐다. 기본 자세 지시로 쓰지 않고, 허리도 조심해야
  하는 사람에게는 쓰지 않는다.
- 머신, 케이블, 덤벨이라서 무릎에 더 좋다는 비교 연구는 없다. 머신은 멈춤 장치로 범위를 고정하고 무게를
  조절하기 쉬워서 쓰기 편할 뿐이다.
- 범위는 057의 무릎 통증 기준(운동 중·후·다음 날 10점 중 2점까지)을 일주일 지키면 한 단계씩 넓힌다.
