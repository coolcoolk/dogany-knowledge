# RIR-accuracy sprint 2026-10-07. Owns the SET
# LOG: how much a logged repetitions-in-reserve number can carry once it is
# stored on a set row -- by set position, rep count / load, distance from
# failure and exercise type -- and what the logger may compute from it (e1RM
# input, floor-breach reading, increase trigger). NOT restated here:
# the method comparison and RIR-vs-plate-step resolution (030), and the
# day-level readiness read and load-step sizes
# (exercise/rir-accuracy-readiness-signals-061, released v37 from the
# research sprint; both rows kept their numbers at the v38 merge, and 061
# links back here). Where this row refines a 061 rule it says so by rule
# name. Both rows carry a block named rir_rules: 061's is the DAY read,
# this row's is the SET log; read each from its own item.
#
# rir_rules is structured data for the set logger / rx code. Values are
# directions plus product constants; each entry carries its own basis_grade.
# The YAML-subset reader returns numbers as strings. No program code changed.

    engine: feed only precise-zone sets; among sets at the same load prefer the one with the lowest logged RIR (nearest failure, most accurate); the resulting e1RM is conservative, so do not discount it further; an e1RM change below the 029 floor is not a verified change

refraction_notes:
  - note: >
      THE LOG LEANS LOW. In the pooled data lifters said they had about one
      rep fewer left than they did, and the first set of an exercise leaned
      lowest. For a logger that is a useful asymmetry: e1RM computed from
      logged RIR comes out conservative, and a logged RIR above target is
      believable. It also means a logged 0-1 may really have been 1-2.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      TWO ZONES, NOT ONE NUMBER. Near failure in a set of 12 or fewer reps,
      trained lifters were within about two-thirds of a rep on the bench.
      Far from failure or in long sets the same people missed by 2 to 5
      reps (16-rep squat sets at 70%). The "4+" key is therefore a category,
      and long sets are progressed by counted reps, not by RIR.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      SQUAT IS HARDER TO READ THAN BENCH. Two trials (an 8-week RCT and a
      3-week powerlifter study) found squat reads less accurate than bench;
      the pooled upper-vs-lower comparison was inconclusive and machine
      lifts showed no exercise effect. Held at C and used only to keep the
      2-exposure rule strict on squat-pattern slots.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      EXPERIENCE NO, PRACTICE MAYBE. Training years did not predict accuracy
      anywhere it was tested. Practice with feedback from sets taken to
      failure improved accuracy in two studies and not in a third. The
      warehouse line "does not improve over six weeks" (030, 061; both
      scoped to it at v38) is the
      third study and should be spoken as one result of three, not as
      settled.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      WHAT A ONE-REP ERROR COSTS. Strength gains were flat across a wide RIR
      range, and stopping at a perceived 1-2 RIR gave similar quadriceps
      growth to failure over eight weeks. A one-rep logging error is
      therefore small for outcomes; it matters for the arithmetic the
      logger does with it (e1RM, triggers), which is why the rules above
      gate that arithmetic rather than the training.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      RETRACTED STUDY EXCLUDED. The widely quoted "RIR is accurate at 85%
      but not at 65-75% of 1RM" comes from a 2020 four-exercise study that
      was retracted in 2021. What survives is weaker: the pooled data tie
      better accuracy to heavier loads through fewer reps per set, and one
      non-retracted study found that knowing the load or its %1RM did not
      change estimates. The logger therefore gates on rep count, not on a
      %1RM cut-off.
    grade: B
claim: >
  A logged repetitions-in-reserve number is a useful but low-leaning
  estimate. Lifters under-predict the reps they have left by about one on
  average (12 studies, 414 people, very heterogeneous), most in the first
  set of an exercise, and far more when the set is long or ended far from
  failure: within about two-thirds of a rep for 1-3 RIR calls on a 75%
  bench, but 2 to 5 reps off on 16-rep squat sets at 70%. Squat reads were
  less accurate than bench in two studies; machine lifts showed no exercise
  effect. Years of training do not predict accuracy; practice with feedback
  from sets taken to failure helped in two studies of three. For a set
  logger this means: use RIR as a number only on sets of 12 reps or fewer
  logged at RIR 0-3; treat "4+" and long sets as ordinal; build e1RM only
  from those sets and accept that it comes out conservative; let a logged
  RIR above target on two consecutive exposures propose an increase; keep
  floor-breach flags but speak them as "close to failure"; and let counted
  reps outrank estimated RIR. All accuracy data are calls made during a set
  that then went to failure; the post-set RIR a logger stores has not been
  validated directly. Every threshold in the rules is a product constant.
reasoning: >
  Halperin 2022 supplies the direction and the moderators (nearer failure,
  12 reps or fewer, later sets, not training status); its I2 of 97.9% is
  why widths are taken from primary studies instead. The two anchor
  primaries bracket the range: Refalo 2024 (trained men and women, 75%
  bench, calls at 1 and 3 RIR, absolute error 0.65 reps, no difference by
  set, session, sex or experience) and Zourdos 2021 (trained men, 70%
  squat to failure at 16 reps, error 2.05 / 3.65 / 5.15 reps at called 1 /
  3 / 5 RIR, driven by reps per set). Mansfield 2020 and Remmert 2023 on
  single-joint machines give the first-set and later-set effect and show
  that knowing the load or its %1RM did not move estimates; the retracted
  Hughes 2020 is the usual source of a %1RM cut-off and is excluded, so the
  rules gate on rep count (Halperin's load effect runs through it).
  Exercise type rests on Hermann 2025 and Helms 2017 (bench better than
  squat) against a null pooled upper-lower contrast and a null exercise
  effect across machine lifts, hence C. Practice is split: Remmert 2023 (n=9,
  6 weeks bench) found no change in absolute error, while Hermann 2025 and
  Wiedenmann 2026 found improvement over sessions ending in failure; this is
  why the row is contested and why calibration is confined to slots where
  failure is permitted, leaving the compound floor policy intact. The
  engine rules translate the bias into arithmetic: e1RM = load x (1 +
  (reps + RIR) / 30) moves about 1/30 of the load per rep, so the bias makes
  e1RM conservative rather than inflated; a high reading is credible
  because the error runs the other way; a single first-set reading is the
  least trustworthy. Robinson 2024 and Refalo 2024 (J Sports Sci) bound the
  cost of a one-rep error on outcomes as small. The final rule records the
  absence: no study validates a post-set estimate without a failure test,
  which is exactly what a logger stores.

# exercise/rir-set-log-accuracy-077 -- 기록된 RIR은 얼마나 믿을 수 있나: 세트 기록기의 사용 규칙

**한 줄 그림:** 기록된 RIR은 대개 실제보다 낮게 적힌다. 12회 이하·RIR 0~3 세트에서는 한 개 안팎으로
맞지만, 긴 세트나 "4+"는 2~5개씩 틀린다. 숫자로 쓰는 곳과 범주로만 쓰는 곳을 나눈다.

## Accuracy by situation

| Situation | What the studies found | Logger use |
|---|---|---|
| 12 reps or fewer, RIR 0-3 | about 0.65 reps absolute error (75% bench) | number: e1RM, floor, trigger |
| over 12 reps, or RIR 4+ | 2-5 reps off (16-rep squat at 70%) | category only; progress by reps |
| first working set of an exercise | least accurate, leans low | no step-down from it alone |
| later sets | more accurate | prefer for e1RM |
| squat-pattern vs bench | squat less accurate (two studies) | keep the 2-exposure rule strict |
| machine / cable lifts | no exercise difference | same rules |
| years of training | no effect | same rules for everyone |
| practice with failure feedback | helped in two of three studies | calibrate only on non-floor slots |

Thresholds (12 reps, RIR 0-3, two exposures) are the plan's rules, not measured cut-offs.

## 한국어 요약 (답변용)

- 사람들은 "몇 개 더 할 수 있었나"를 평균 한 개쯤 적게 말한다. 그래서 기록된 RIR은 실제 여유의
  아래쪽 값에 가깝다. 여유분을 더 빼지도, 보정값을 더하지도 않고 그대로 읽는다.
- 12회 이하 세트에서 RIR 0~3으로 기록했다면 한 개 안팎으로 맞는다(벤치 75%에서 평균 0.65개 차이).
  이런 세트만 숫자로 써서 추정 1RM과 증량 판단에 쓴다.
- 12회가 넘는 세트나 "4+"는 2~5개씩 틀렸다(스쿼트 70%, 16회 세트). "아직 여유가 많다"는 뜻으로만
  읽고, 이런 세트는 같은 무게에서 반복 수를 늘려 진행한다.
- 운동의 첫 세트가 가장 부정확하고 실제보다 힘들게 느껴진다. 첫 세트 RIR 하나만 보고 무게를 내리지
  않는다. 실제로 몇 개를 했는지, 다음 세트가 어땠는지를 같이 본다.
- 추정 1RM은 RIR이 한 개 적게 적히면 2.5~3% 정도 낮게 나온다. 그래서 기록에서 나온 추정 1RM은
  보수적인 값이고, 더 깎을 필요가 없다.
- 목표보다 RIR이 1개 이상 높게, 같은 무게로 두 번 연속 기록되면 증량을 제안한다. 기록이 원래 낮게
  적히는 쪽이라 높게 적힌 값은 믿을 만하다. 한 번만이면 지켜보자고만 말한다.
- 하한(RIR 2)이 걸린 종목에서 0~1이 기록되면 경고는 그대로 내되, "실패했다"가 아니라 "실패에 꽤
  가까웠다"고 말한다. 기록된 숫자는 고치지 않는다.
- 스쿼트는 벤치보다 RIR 읽기가 부정확했다(두 연구). 머신·케이블 운동끼리는 차이가 없었다.
- 운동 경력이 길다고 더 정확하지 않았다. 실패까지 가 보고 차이를 확인하는 연습은 세 연구 중 두
  곳에서 정확도를 높였다. 그런 확인은 머신·케이블·고립 운동에서만 하고, 하한이 걸린 복합 프리웨이트
  종목에서는 하지 않는다.
- 같은 무게에서 반복 수가 늘었다면 그게 진행의 증거다. 셀 수 있는 반복 수가 추정인 RIR보다 앞선다.
- 이 연구들은 모두 세트 도중에 "이제 몇 개 남았다"고 말한 뒤 실패까지 해서 확인했다. 세트를 끝낸 뒤
  적는 RIR을 직접 검증한 연구는 없다. 기록된 RIR을 측정값처럼 말하지 않는다.
- "85%에서는 정확하고 65~75%에서는 부정확하다"는 널리 퍼진 결과는 철회된 논문에서 나왔다. 쓰지
  않는다.
