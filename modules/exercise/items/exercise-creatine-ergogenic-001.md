      The +10-20% performance figure is an upper-bound generalization drawn

claim: >
  Creatine monohydrate is the most effective ergogenic aid for
  high-intensity/repetitive exercise (performance improvement on the order of
  +10-20% after a loading phase) and for lean-mass gain; it is safe at up to
  30 g/day for 5 years in healthy adults with no pre-existing renal disease.
reasoning: >
  The ISSN 2017 position stand carries a disclosed supplement-industry conflict,
  but independent bodies neutralize it: the Australian Institute of Sport rates
  creatine Group A (strongest evidence) and the IOC 2018 consensus corroborates
  efficacy and safety. Because converging systematic reviews plus independent
  institutional corroboration is exactly what the GRADE spine treats as
  high-certainty, this reaches the top confidence band. Safety derives from
  monitoring and long-term observational follow-up. Safety-critical: disclose
  the confidence band, the as-of range, and applicability up front, and withhold
  a specific dose green-light when renal status is unknown or refused.

# exercise/creatine-ergogenic-001

Creatine monohydrate is the best-evidenced ergogenic aid in the strength and
power space. The efficacy signal (short-duration, high-intensity, repeated-bout
work and lean-mass accrual) is corroborated across independent institutional
bodies, which is what lifts it above a single society stand that would otherwise
be discounted for industry conflict.

The safety envelope (up to 30 g/day for five years in healthy adults) applies to
people without pre-existing renal disease. When renal status is unknown or the
user declines to share it, the answer path gives the general mechanism and the
population-level finding but withholds a specific dose recommendation -- it does
not go silent. Endurance-only athletes should discount the performance figure.
