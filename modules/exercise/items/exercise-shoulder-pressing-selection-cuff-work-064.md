# Shoulder sprint 2026-10-06, on top of the
# injury-caution rows 054 / 055 / 056. The shoulder is among the commonest
# injury sites in weight-training sports (Keogh & Winwood 2017, cited in 054),
# and 055 / 056 already say a familiar rotator-cuff-type ache keeps loading
# under a pain ceiling. This row answers the next question the split / caution
# code has to decide for a PRESSING lifter with subacromial / rotator-cuff
# related shoulder pain (RCRSP) or history at the shoulder: which variants to
# keep, which to drop, and what cuff / scapular work to add. The prep half
# (specific drills vs general warm-up) is the companion row 065.
#
# selection_rules is structured data for the split / caution code, same posture
# as 056's decision_ladder: DIRECTIONS and ORDERINGS, each rule naming its
# basis and its own grade. No load in kilograms, no risk figure.

refraction_notes:
  - note: >
      LOADING IS THE TREATMENT, AND IT HAS TO PROGRESS. For subacromial /
      rotator-cuff related shoulder pain, exercise therapy is the first-line
      recommendation across systematic reviews. The pooled trials suggest the
      effect sits with exercise that is resisted and progressed in load;
      range-of-motion or unloaded exercise showed no effect against no
      treatment. For the engine: cuff work at the shoulder site is a
      progressing working-set exercise, not a token warm-up drill.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      SPECIFIC VS GENERAL IS NOT SETTLED. One good trial in people who had
      failed earlier care found cuff-plus-scapular exercise produced far more
      recoveries and far fewer surgeries than unspecific movement, and one
      low-quality meta-analysis agrees; another meta-analysis found no
      difference, and scapula-focused programmes lose their edge by three
      months. Speak it as "targeted cuff and scapular work is a reasonable
      default", never as "targeted beats general".
    grade: C
  - note: >
      THE LIFTER-SPECIFIC SIGNALS ARE THIN. In one cross-sectional sample of
      recreational weight trainers, impingement signs were associated with
      lateral raises and upright rows taken above shoulder height and were
      less common in those who trained the external rotators. Association,
      not cause, one sample of men. It justifies capping those two lifts at
      shoulder height for a caution site and adding external-rotator work,
      not banning them for everyone.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      BENCH GRIP AND SCAPULA. A musculoskeletal model of experienced lifters
      at a light load found that a grip under about 1.5 times shoulder width
      and a retracted scapula lowered the modelled joint and cuff loads, and
      older clinical reviews give the same advice. No injury outcome was
      measured. Use it for a caution site; do not present it as a proven
      injury-prevention rule.
    grade: D
  - note: >
      MACHINES ARE A CHEAP SUBSTITUTION. Free-weight and machine training
      produced the same strength and hypertrophy in direct comparison; each
      wins only on its own test. So moving a caution-site lifter from a
      barbell to a machine press for a block costs muscle and general
      strength nothing measurable. Whether machines lower shoulder injury
      risk has not been tested (GAPS.md).
    grade: B
claim: >
  For a pressing lifter with subacromial or rotator-cuff related shoulder
  pain, or a history of it, the evidence-backed default is to keep pressing
  and change the variant, while adding progressive external-rotation and
  scapular work. Exercise is the first-line treatment for this pain, and the
  effect is carried by exercise that is resisted and progressed; unloaded
  range-of-motion work showed none. Cuff-plus-scapular programmes beat
  unspecific movement in one good trial (69% vs 24% recovered, 20% vs 63% went
  to surgery), but meta-analyses disagree on whether targeted beats general,
  and scapula-focused gains fade by three months, so targeted work is a
  default, not a proven superiority. In recreational lifters, impingement signs
  were associated with lateral raises and upright rows above shoulder height
  and were less common in those who trained the external rotators
  (cross-sectional). A light-load model and clinical reviews favour a bench grip
  no wider than about 1.5 times shoulder width with the scapula retracted.
  Swapping free weights for machines keeps hypertrophy and general strength, so
  machine pressing is a low-cost substitute for the highest-load variants.
  Present pain progresses under the 055 ceiling; red-flag shoulder pain is
  routed, not coached.
reasoning: >
  The first-line rule rests on Pieters 2020, an umbrella of sixteen systematic
  reviews, and Naunton 2020, which isolates progressive resisted exercise as
  the active ingredient at low certainty. Holmgren 2012 is the strongest single
  trial for cuff-plus-scapular work, but its control was deliberately
  unspecific and its population had failed prior care; Shire 2017 and Bury
  2016 temper the specific-over-general reading, hence contested and C for that
  half. Kolber 2014 is the only located study in recreational weight trainers;
  it is cross-sectional and read at abstract, so the variant caps are C and
  apply at caution rungs only. Noteboom 2024 is a model at 16 kg with no injury
  outcome, and Green & Comfort 2007 and Fees 1998 are opinion-level reviews
  cited from their records; the grip and end-range rules are held at D. Haugen
  2023 is a meta-analysis of direct comparisons and supports the substitution
  claim for hypertrophy and strength, not for injury. The injury_history axis
  is hard with block_specifics, matching 055 and 056: without the user's words
  on the shoulder's rung, specific variant limits are withheld and the one
  merged ask applies.

## 한국어 요약 (답변용)

- 어깨 앞·옆이 아픈 회전근개·견봉하 통증은 운동이 1순위 치료다. 그리고 효과는 무게를 올려 가는
  저항 운동에서 나왔다. 가동범위만 돌리는 운동은 아무것도 안 한 것과 차이가 없었다. 그러니
  외회전 운동은 몸풀기 한두 세트가 아니라 본운동 안에서 무게를 늘려 가는 종목으로 넣는다.
- 회전근개+견갑 운동이 일반 운동보다 낫다고 단정하지는 않는다. 다른 치료가 안 듣던 사람을 대상으로 한
  연구에서는 훨씬 많이 좋아지고 수술도 훨씬 덜 받았지만, 메타분석끼리 결론이 엇갈리고 견갑 위주
  운동의 우위는 3개월쯤이면 사라졌다. "기본으로 넣을 만하다" 정도로 말한다.
- 헬스 하는 사람들을 본 횡단 연구에서 사이드 레터럴 레이즈·업라이트 로우를 어깨 높이 위로
  올리는 사람에게 충돌 증후군 징후가 많았고, 외회전 근력을 따로 단련하는 사람에게는 적었다. 원인이라고
  확정된 건 아니다. 주의 부위가 있는 사람만 어깨 높이까지로 제한한다.
- 벤치 그립은 어깨너비의 약 1.5배 이내, 날개뼈를 모은 자세가 어깨에 걸리는 부하를 줄인다는
  모델 연구가 있다. 실제 부상을 추적한 연구는 아니다.
- 바벨 대신 머신 프레스로 바꿔도 근비대·근력은 손해가 없다. 프리웨이트 1RM처럼 그 동작 자체의
  힘만 덜 오른다. 머신이 부상을 줄이는지는 연구된 적이 없다.
- 지금 아픈 어깨는 통증 기준(운동 중·후 10점 중 5점까지, 다음 날 아침 회복, 주마다 늘지 않음)을
  지키며 무게를 올린다. 밤에 아프거나, 힘이 빠지거나, 빠질 것 같거나, 다친 직후이거나, 저리면
  여기서 처방하지 않고 통증 확인으로 보낸다.
