# Equipment sprint 2026-10-07. The
# engine-readable SELECTION half: when the composer should rank a machine (or
# cable / supported) variant first for a working-set slot, and when a
# free-weight lift must be kept. A routing rule over 075 (evidence), 056
# (caution ladder) and the ED surveillance row cited below; same posture as
# 031, 032 and 056 -- each rule names the graded row it rests on and its own
# basis_grade, and product constants are labelled as constants.
#
# equipment_rules is structured data for the composer
# (compose_rank_rules, which today has only an
# `equipment` availability exclude and an `equipment_variety` repeat penalty;
# prep/cooldown drills are already machine-first by product rule 2026-10-06).
# Values are PREFERENCES and KEEP-constraints, not scores; no number here is
# a load or a risk figure.

refraction_notes:
  - note: >
      THE SWAP IS FREE FOR MUSCLE, NOT FOR A NAMED LIFT. Because no growth
      difference was found between modalities (075), a machine can replace a
      free-weight lift for hypertrophy without a stated penalty. Because
      strength is test-specific, it cannot replace a lift the user wants to
      get stronger at; that lift stays.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      MACHINE-FIRST AT A CAUTION SITE IS A JUDGEMENT, NOT A FINDING. The
      reasoning is mechanism: a fixed path, a stack that stops, and no bar to
      drop or bail from, while most emergency-department weight-room injuries
      involve free weights and dropped loads (Kerr 2010). That survey has no
      exposure denominator, so it does NOT show machines have a lower injury
      rate. No trial tests machine-first loading after injury. Speak it as the
      plan's rule.
    grade: D
  - note: >
      A MACHINE DOES NOT CLEAR A SITE. For pain that the 056 ladder routes to
      triage (joint, ligament, muscle, unknown tissue, red flags), swapping to
      a machine is not a way around the triage step.
    grade: D
  - note: >
      FATIGUE AND CUT: LEAST EVIDENCE. Moving accessories to machines during a
      cut or a high-fatigue week is coaching practice built on lower setup and
      stabilising demand. No trial measures fatigue, recovery or lean-mass
      retention by modality in a deficit, and the deficit-volume guidance it
      sits beside is itself theory-only (016).
    grade: D
  - note: >
      MACHINES HAVE THEIR OWN LIMITS. Fixed stacks can make progression jumps
      large (no research on stack increments, 027); a machine that does not
      fit the body should be swapped, not forced (020); and older adults are
      injured on machines too (Kerr 2010).
    grade: D
claim: >
  The composer may rank a machine, cable or supported variant first for a
  working-set slot in four cases: the goal is muscle size (no growth
  difference between modalities, so the swap costs nothing measurable); the
  slot loads a caution site at the recent / undated history or loaded-tendon
  rung of the 056 ladder; a set is planned near failure without a known
  spotter or safety stop; or the user is in a cut or a high-fatigue week
  (accessory slots only). It must keep a free-weight lift when the user's
  goal names that lift (strength is test-specific) and keep one free-standing
  lower-body lift weekly when the goal is jumping, sprinting or a field
  sport. A machine never reopens a site closed for triage, a machine that
  does not fit is swapped for a dumbbell or cable variant, and machines are
  not presented as injury-free. Only the hypertrophy swap and the strength
  keep rest on trial evidence; the caution, unspotted-failure and cut
  preferences are product judgement on mechanism.
reasoning: >
  075 supplies the two evidence-backed edges: the hypertrophy null that
  licenses the swap and the strength specificity that limits it, plus the
  squat-vs-leg-press jump result behind the performance keep. The caution
  rule plugs into 056's rungs rather than inventing new ones: the rungs that
  already spread load and drop high-load variants are the ones where a
  fixed-path variant is preferred, while the rungs that go to triage keep 031's
  behaviour. Kerr 2010 gives the mechanism picture (free weights, dropped
  loads, more fractures) and also its limit (no exposure denominator, and a
  larger share of machine injuries in people 55 and over), so it backs a
  preference, not a safety claim. The fatigue / cut rule inherits 016's
  theory-only floor. The injury_history axis is hard with block_specifics as
  in 056: without the user's words on the site's rung, the caution rule is
  not applied to a specific site.

# exercise/machine-first-selection-rules-076 -- 언제 머신을 먼저 고르나

**한 줄 그림:** 근육이 목표면 머신으로 바꿔도 손해가 확인되지 않았다. 다만 키우고 싶은 바벨
종목은 남기고, 주의 부위·보조자 없는 실패 세트·감량기에는 머신을 먼저 고른다(이건 제품 판단).

## The rules (engine-readable: `equipment_rules`)

| Rule | When | Prefer / keep | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| hypertrophy-swap-free | goal = muscle size | machine = free weight; pick by availability, fit, variety | 075 |
| strength-keep-named-lift | goal names a barbell lift | keep that lift as the primary slot | 075 |
| performance-keep-free-standing | goal = jump / sprint / sport | keep one free-standing lower lift weekly | 075 |
| caution-site-machine-first | site at history-recent / unknown / current-load-pain | machine or supported variant first at that site | 056 + mechanism |
| caution-triage-no-swap | site at current-other / red-flag | no swap; triage first | 031 |
| near-failure-unspotted | near-failure set, no spotter or safety stop | machine, or leave reps in reserve | Kerr 2010 mechanism |
| fatigue-or-cut-accessories | cut or high fatigue | machine-first for accessories | 016, practice |
| fit-mismatch-swap | machine does not fit | dumbbell / cable instead | 020 |
| older-adult-not-risk-free | 55+ | machines allowed, cues still given | Kerr 2010 |

## 한국어 요약 (답변용)

- 근육을 키우는 게 목표면 머신과 프리웨이트를 같은 선택지로 본다. 근육 성장 차이가 발견되지 않았으니,
  있는 장비·몸에 맞는지·주간 장비 반복 여부로 고른다.
- 스쿼트·벤치·데드리프트처럼 사용자가 목표로 이름 붙인 종목이 있으면 그 종목은 주 운동으로 남긴다.
  근력은 연습한 도구에서 더 오르기 때문이다. 머신은 보조 운동 자리를 채운다.
- 점프·달리기·구기 종목이 목표면 서서 하는 하체 프리웨이트(스쿼트·런지·힙힌지)를 주에 하나는 남긴다.
  레그프레스는 양을 더할 뿐 대신하지 않는다.
- 최근 다쳤거나 언제 다쳤는지 모르는 부위, 또는 익숙한 힘줄·족저근막 통증이 있는 부위는 머신·케이블·
  지지되는 동작을 먼저 고른다. 궤도가 정해져 있고, 떨어뜨릴 바가 없어서다. 다만 머신이 부상을
  줄인다는 연구는 없다. 응급실 통계에서 웨이트 부상 대부분이 프리웨이트와 떨어진 무게였지만,
  사용 시간을 감안한 비교가 아니다. "계획의 규칙"으로 말한다.
- 관절·인대·근육 통증, 어디가 아픈지 모르는 통증, 위험 신호가 있는 부위는 머신으로 바꿔도 다시
  열지 않는다. 통증 확인이 먼저다.
- 보조자나 안전바 없이 실패 직전까지 하는 세트는 머신으로 하거나, 프리웨이트면 몇 회 남기고 멈춘다.
- 감량기나 피로가 큰 주에는 보조 운동을 머신 위주로 한다. 근거가 가장 약한 규칙이다.
- 머신이 몸에 안 맞는다고 하면(좌석, 회전축, 손잡이 폭, 그 기계에서만 아픔) 덤벨·케이블로 바꾼다.
  55세 이상도 머신을 먼저 써도 되지만, 응급실에 온 이 나이대 부상 중 머신 비중이 더 컸던 만큼
  자세·세팅 안내는 빼지 않는다.
