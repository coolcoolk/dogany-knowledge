# Body-ideal archetype sprint, pass 2 (2026-09-30).
# "사이클 선수 몸" -- split from the endurance row (042), which is written
# runner-first. Cycling is weight-supported: little impact injury, but no
# bone-loading, and the power-to-weight scoreboard is watts per kg. The track
# sprinter (huge quads) is a different picture from the road rider.

refraction_notes:
  - note: >
      ASK ROAD OR TRACK. The road / climbing rider is light and lean with a
      slim upper body (power-to-weight); the track sprinter carries very large
      quadriceps and glutes (peak power). Most users mean the road rider; the
      measures differ (sustained watts per kg vs peak power).
    grade: D
  - note: >
      CYCLING DOES NOT LOAD BONE. Road cyclists in regular training show low
      bone density in the lumbar spine. A cyclist strand keeps heavy strength
      work and some impact (jumps, running, hiking) in the week -- for bone,
      and because heavy strength improves cycling economy.
    grade: B
claim: >
  The cyclist ideal is a lean, light body with strong quadriceps, glutes and
  calves, a trunk that holds a forward position for hours and a very large
  aerobic engine, judged by sustained power relative to body weight. Because
  cycling is weight-supported it spares the joints but does not build bone:
  road cyclists who train regularly have low bone density in key regions.
  Heavy strength training added to cycling improves economy and performance,
  and overuse symptoms follow load while most bike-fit measures show no link.
  Road injuries are mostly abrasions and upper-limb fractures from crashes. It
  differs from the runner (042) by the weight support, the bone risk and the
  watts-per-kg scoreboard, and from the rower by the lighter upper body.
reasoning: >
  Bone findings are two systematic reviews of mostly cross-sectional studies
  (Olmedillas 2012, Nagle 2011). The strength-for-cycling claim is a
  narrative review of trials (Ronnestad & Mujika 2014). Overuse risk factors
  and road-injury patterns are systematic reviews whose own authors call the
  evidence limited. The mortality association is a large observational cohort,
  not causal. The picture is craft.

# exercise/ideal-cyclist-050 -- 사이클 선수형

**한 줄 그림:** 가볍고 군살 없는 몸에 허벅지와 엉덩이가 단단한, 몇 시간을 일정한 힘으로 밟는 몸.

## Distinguishing features

Sustained power per kg; quadriceps/glute dominance; slim upper body (road);
trunk endurance in a flexed position; very large aerobic engine. Track
sprinters are a separate, heavier picture.

## Measurable here

- `body_weight`, `body_fat_pct` (power-to-weight context).
- `e1rm_<squat>` or `e1rm_<leg_press>` (heavy strength for economy and bone).
- `weekly_sessions`; rides as workouts `minutes`, `avg_hr` (readable, not
  strand tokens).

## Not measurable here

Power output (FTP, watts per kg), ride distance, time-trial times, bone
density. Proposed: `ftp_w_per_kg`, `ride_km_week`, `cardio_minutes_week`.

## Training emphasis and practice

Mostly easy aerobic riding with some threshold and interval work, 2 heavy
low-rep lower-body strength sessions a week, some impact (jumps, running,
hiking) for bone, trunk and hip-flexor/thoracic mobility against the riding
posture. Picks: `conditioning` primary, `power`, `mobility_flow`.

## Failure modes

Low bone density from riding-only training; knee (patellofemoral) pain with
sudden load jumps; crash injuries; dropping strength work; chasing a lower
body weight for climbing.

## Combines / conflicts

Aligns with the runner/triathlete and healthy-lean rows; compatible with the
classic X legs (cycling costs less muscle growth than running -- see 042).
Conflicts with open bodybuilding and powerlifting mass on climbs, and with
climbing only in shared lightness pressure.
