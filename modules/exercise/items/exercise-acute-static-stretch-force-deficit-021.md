      Outcome-breadth caveat, and this is the load-bearing one. The popular
      framing is that static stretching before lifting blunts strength AND
      power. The 2024 multilevel meta separates the outcomes and only the
      first survives: isolated maximal strength ES -0.21 (p=0.003), but
      jump ES +0.15 (p=0.006, a trivial BENEFIT in adults), sprint/throwing
      ES +0.13 (p=0.20, not significant), and explosive strength / rate of
      force development ES -0.03 (p=0.86, nothing at all). So the deficit is
      demonstrated for slow maximal force tested in isolation, not for
      explosive or multi-joint whole-body tasks.
    grade: B

      Context caveat. Every meta-level percentage above is measured with
      stretching as an ISOLATED treatment immediately before an isolated
      test. When short static stretching is embedded inside a comprehensive
      warm-up that continues with dynamic and task-specific work, the effect
      disappears: Blazevich 2018 (randomized, crossover, experimenter-blinded,
      20 team-sport athletes, 9 body regions) found no effect of 5 s static,
      30 s static, or 5-repetition dynamic stretching on sprint, jump, or
      change-of-direction. Warneke 2024 concludes a rigorous prohibition on
      including stretching in a warm-up is without evidence.
    grade: B
  - note: >
      Population and quality limit. The pooled evidence is dominated by young
      adult males; the 2024 meta states outright that data in children and in
      females are insufficient and its results are not interpretable for those
      groups. Mean methodological quality is poor (PEDro 3.95/10) and the
      authors label the body of evidence low-certainty. The 480 s cumulative-
      volume threshold the same meta reports (ES -0.46, p=0.03) is described
      by its own authors as somewhat arbitrary. Treat the numbers as directional.
    grade: C
  - note: >
      Untested extrapolation, flagged so it is not silently assumed. No trial
      in this body of evidence tests what a multi-set heavy compound resistance
      SESSION does after stretching. All outcomes are single-effort tests
      (one maximal contraction, one jump, one sprint). Whether a pre-session
      static stretch changes reps-at-load across a working session is
      undetermined, not shown to be safe and not shown to be harmful.
    grade: D
claim: >
  Acute static stretching produces a DURATION-DEPENDENT force deficit, and the
  threshold is consistent across independent syntheses at roughly 60 seconds of
  accumulated stretch PER MUSCLE GROUP. Under 60 s per muscle group the effect
  is trivial and statistically indistinguishable from zero (approximately 1-2%
  performance change; pooled ES -0.13, p=0.20). At or over 60 s per muscle
  group the deficit becomes substantial (approximately 4-7.5%; pooled ES -0.84,
  p=0.004). Critically, the deficit is demonstrated for MAXIMAL STRENGTH TESTED
  IN ISOLATION and does NOT extend to jumping, sprinting, or rate of force
  development, which show trivial or null effects. When short-duration static
  stretching sits inside a full warm-up that continues with dynamic and
  task-specific work, no performance effect is detectable at all. Practical
  direction: a brief static hold (well under 60 s per muscle) placed inside a
  fuller warm-up carries no measurable performance cost; long static holds
  immediately before a maximal-strength effort do carry one and should be moved
  away from the pre-lift slot.
reasoning: >
  Two independent meta-level syntheses converge on the same duration threshold
  from different methods. Behm et al. 2016 (Appl Physiol Nutr Metab 41(1):1-11),
  the field's most-cited systematic review, reports a percent-change dose
  response of -1.1% under 60 s versus -4.6% at or above 60 s per muscle group
  (static stretching overall -3.7%, dynamic +1.3%, PNF -4.4%). Chaabene et al.
  2019 (Front Physiol 10:1468) restates the same split as 1-2% versus 4.0-7.5%.
  Warneke & Lohmann 2024 (J Sport Health Sci 13(6):805-819, PMID 38735533)
  re-derives it with a multilevel meta-analysis over 83 controlled pre-post
  studies, 2012 participants and more than 400 effect sizes, and lands on
  ES -0.13 (n.s.) under 60 s versus ES -0.84 (p=0.004) at or above 60 s.
  Agreement across a vote-counting review and a modern multilevel meta on the
  same threshold is what carries the confidence here. What the 2024 meta ALSO
  does is break the effect out by outcome, and that is where the popular version
  of this claim fails: jump performance shows a trivial positive effect
  (ES +0.15, p=0.006), sprint and throwing are null, and rate of force
  development is flatly null (ES -0.03, p=0.86). The deficit is therefore
  specific to slow maximal force production tested in isolation. Blazevich
  et al. 2018 (Med Sci Sports Exerc 50(6):1258-1266) supplies the ecological
  test: with 20 male team-sport athletes in a randomized, experimenter-blinded
  crossover across nine body regions, neither 5 s nor 30 s of static stretching
  nor 5 repetitions of dynamic stretching changed sprint, jump, or change-of-
  direction performance when performed inside a comprehensive warm-up. The
  contested flag is on OUTCOME BREADTH and MAGNITUDE, not on the duration
  direction: coaching practice widely asserts a general pre-lift power penalty
  that the outcome-stratified evidence does not support, and the underlying
  study quality is low (mean PEDro 3.95/10, authors' own certainty rating low).

# exercise/acute-static-stretch-force-deficit-021

Holding a static stretch before training does reduce force, but only under
conditions much narrower than the gym-floor version of the rule suggests. Two
things decide it: how long the hold is, and what you measure afterwards.

Duration is the clean part. Under about 60 seconds of total stretching per
muscle group, the measured effect is roughly one to two percent and is
statistically indistinguishable from no effect at all. At or beyond 60 seconds
per muscle group it becomes real -- roughly four to seven and a half percent,
a large pooled effect. Two independent syntheses built with different methods,
a widely cited 2016 systematic review and a 2024 multilevel meta-analysis over
83 studies and more than 2,000 participants, land on the same 60-second line.
That convergence is the strongest thing in this literature.

What you measure afterwards is where the popular version breaks. The 2024
meta-analysis splits the outcomes apart, and the deficit only appears in one of
them: maximal strength tested in isolation, one slow maximal contraction. Jump
performance actually came out marginally BETTER after stretching. Sprinting and
throwing showed nothing. Rate of force development -- explosive force, the exact
quality the popular claim says stretching destroys -- showed nothing whatsoever.
So "static stretching kills your power" is not what the pooled evidence says.

And the context matters as much as the dose. When short static holds are placed
inside a complete warm-up that then continues with dynamic movement and
task-specific work, the effect vanishes entirely: a randomized, blinded
crossover on 20 athletes across nine body regions found no difference at all
between 5 seconds of static stretching, 30 seconds of static stretching,
dynamic stretching, and no stretching.

Honest limits. The underlying study quality is poor -- mean methodological score
under 4 out of 10, and the meta's own authors call the certainty low. The
subject pool is overwhelmingly young adult men, and the 2024 authors state
explicitly that their results should not be read across to women or children.
And nobody has tested the thing an actual lifter cares about: whether a
pre-session stretch changes reps-at-load across a multi-set heavy compound
session. Every measured outcome here is a single effort, not a session.

## Implication for a warm-up block

Static holds before strength work: keep the accumulated hold per muscle
group short (under about 60 s) or embed it early in a fuller warm-up that is
followed by dynamic work and the load ramp. The evidence does not support
banning a short static hold on "stretching kills your power" grounds -- the
deficit is confined to isolated maximal strength.
