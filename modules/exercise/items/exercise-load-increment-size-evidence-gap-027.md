      Provenance of the 2-10% rule, traced to the end. ACSM 2009 (p.690)
      prescribes raising load by 2-10% -- the lower end for small-muscle-mass
      exercises, the higher end for large -- once the lifter exceeds the rep
      target by 1-2 reps on two consecutive sessions. This is the most-cited
      increment number in the field. Its sole supporting citation is Feigenbaum
      & Pollock 1999, a NARRATIVE PRESCRIPTION REVIEW, not an increment
      experiment. So the number is a consensus prescription resting on
      non-experimental support. The 2-repetition trigger and the small-vs-large
      muscle direction are worth keeping as structure; the 2-10% figure should
      never be spoken as a measured result.
    grade: D
  - note: >
      ACSM 2026 is SILENT on increment magnitude, and silence is not
      repudiation. The successor stand (Currier, D'Souza et al., Phillips)
      updates the progression position and returns zero hits for "increment" or
      "2-10%". It does say, verbatim, that "progression is not necessary to
      achieve beneficial outcomes, and overload, or more accurately, increasing
      the stimulus in some manner, is likely a requirement only for those
      seeking continued longer term progress." Read that as a de-emphasis of
      progression as an obligation, NOT as a withdrawal of the 2009 number. An
      argument from silence is being recorded here explicitly so a later reader
      cannot promote it into "ACSM retracted the 2-10% rule". Nobody retracted
      anything; the topic simply stopped being addressed.

      The one trial that exists, and what it actually found. Hostler, Crill,
      Hagerman & Staron 2001 (J Strength Cond Res 15(1):86-91) is the only
      known study that manipulates increment MAGNITUDE: n=19 (10 women,
      9 men), untrained for at least six months, bench press and triceps press
      only. Micro-increments came out "as effective as" traditional loading,
      BUT the authors also wrote that "preliminary data suggest that the TRAD
      progressive resistance exercise program might be a more effective method
      of increasing resistance during an extended period." The study declares
      no non-inferiority margin and runs no equivalence test, so at n=19 the
      finding is an UNREJECTED NULL, not demonstrated equivalence. It is also
      untrained and upper-body only, so it does not reach the trained lifter.

      Zombie claim, and the correction is subtler than "it does not exist".
      Content-farm sites (Speediance and others) repost a claim that "a JSCR
      study showed smaller weight increments produce more consistent strength
      gains", with no author, year or DOI. Two research passes in this sprint
      concluded it was a pure phantom. A verification pass then found that a
      real, on-point JSCR paper DOES exist -- Hostler 2001 -- and it points the
      OTHER WAY: micro-loading was merely not-worse, and the traditional
      program trended better over an extended period. So the correct handling
      is not "no such study exists" but "a real study exists and the reposted
      claim misrepresents its direction". Recorded this way deliberately, so a
      future sprint that rediscovers Hostler does not mistake it for
      confirmation of the reposted claim.

      "Microplates beat stalling" is unsupported, not merely weak. No trial
      compares a micro-loading progression against a stall-and-reset
      progression. The arithmetic that gets offered in its place shows only
      that large increments become unsustainable as the bar gets heavy, which
      is a statement about arithmetic, not evidence that small increments
      produce more adaptation. Speakable at most as practitioner reasoning;
      never as "research shows". Related and equally unfilled: failed-increment
      and reset protocols are untested. The nearest RCT, Coleman et al. 2024
      (PeerJ, PMC10809978, n=39 trained), tested a one-week COMPLETE CESSATION
      deload at the midpoint of a 9-week program and found it IMPAIRED
      lower-body strength gains while doing nothing for hypertrophy -- but
      cessation is not a load reduction and not a reset, so the reset question
      remains open rather than answered negatively.

      Upper vs lower: keep the arithmetic, reject the physiology. The popular
      framing -- "the upper body adapts more slowly, therefore it needs smaller
      jumps" -- does not survive. Its usual support, Jung et al. 2023 (PLOS ONE
      18(4):e0284216, 31 studies, n=621 young trained women), is unusable as
      stated: the published abstract carries LABEL-SWAP TYPOS, printing
      "7.2%/wk upper, 5.2%/wk lower" in the Conclusion while the title, the
      frequency line and the body text all say the opposite, so the correct
      reading is 7.2%/wk LOWER and 5.2%/wk UPPER. Beyond the typo, the primary
      pooled effect is 0.47 with a 95% CI of -0.13 to 1.08 -- NOT significant --
      and reaches significance only after post-hoc removal of an outlier
      (Moghadasi, +260% triceps extension in 12 weeks). The subgroup result,
      verbatim and confirmed, finds NO upper/lower difference in
      resistance-training beginners; the difference appears only in
      intermediate and advanced subjects. The population is young healthy women
      only. Never store 7.2%/wk as a sustainable rate -- compounded, it implies
      more than 100% in ten weeks. What DOES survive is pure arithmetic and
      needs no physiology: a fixed absolute increment is a much larger relative
      jump on a light lift than on a heavy one. 2.5 kg is 4.17% of a 60 kg
      bench and 1.8% of a 140 kg squat. That is the whole of the defensible
      case for smaller absolute jumps on smaller lifts.

      Direction of the practitioner tables runs OPPOSITE to the popular
      microplate framing. The NSCA-lineage increment table advises LARGER
      absolute increments for MORE-trained lifters (less-trained: upper
      2.5-5 lb, lower 5-10 lb; more-trained: upper 5-10+ lb, lower 10-15+ lb --
      note 2.5-5, not the frequently miscopied 2-5). That direction is real and
      is worth knowing precisely because it contradicts the assumption that
      advanced lifters need finer steps. But the attribution could not be
      verified: the commonly cited Baechle & Earle locator did not check out,
      and the only authoritative trail this sprint found is NSCA's Essentials
      of Tactical Strength and Conditioning (Alvar, Sell & Deuster, Eds.,
      Human Kinetics, 2017). Store at the practitioner floor, with the
      unverified primary locator stated, and do not invent a table number.

      SAFETY RAIL, EXPLICITLY DROPPED. The circulating claim that "load
      progression above 15%/week raises injury risk 21-49%" must not enter any
      product as a safety limit. It traces to the acute:chronic workload ratio
      literature, whose central injury sweet-spot figure has a RETRACTION
      REQUEST filed against it (Impellizzeri et al.), is statistically unstable
      at low chronic load, carries no causal estimation, and describes weekly
      AGGREGATE load in team sport rather than per-session barbell increments.
      Dropped outright, not downgraded. The accompanying absence is itself the
      finding: there is NO evidence linking per-session increment SIZE to
      injury incidence in resistance training, in either direction. An
      increment recommendation may be argued from sustainability or from
      technique, never from injury data, because there is none.
    grade: D
claim: >
  How BIG a load increment should be is an unstudied variable, and the numbers
  in circulation are prescriptions rather than findings. The field's most-cited
  figure -- the ACSM 2009 rule to raise load by 2-10% (lower end for
  small-muscle-mass exercises, higher for large) once the lifter exceeds the rep
  target by 1-2 reps on two consecutive sessions -- carries exactly one
  supporting citation, and that citation is a narrative prescription review, not
  an increment experiment. The 2026 ACSM update is completely silent on
  increment magnitude, which is an absence of treatment, not a repudiation.
  Exactly ONE trial has ever manipulated increment magnitude (Hostler 2001,
  n=19, untrained, bench and triceps press only): micro-increments were "as
  effective as" traditional ones, with no equivalence test and no
  non-inferiority margin, and the same authors noted that traditional loading
  might be more effective over an extended period. That is an unrejected null,
  not demonstrated equivalence. Consequently: "increment size matters" is an
  EVIDENCE GAP, not a finding, and so is its negation. What can be stated
  without evidence-borrowing is arithmetic -- a fixed absolute step is a much
  larger relative jump on a light lift (2.5 kg is 4.17% of a 60 kg bench, 1.8%
  of a 140 kg squat) -- and the empirical direction of the practitioner tables,
  which recommend LARGER absolute increments for more-trained lifters, opposite
  to the popular microplate framing. No evidence links per-session increment
  size to injury incidence in either direction.
reasoning: >
  This item exists because the source-trace terminates, not because the trace
  was shallow. ACSM 2009 (Ratamess et al., Med Sci Sports Exerc 41(3):687-708)
  states the 2-10% rule on p.690, verified against the PDF; following its
  citation leads to Feigenbaum & Pollock 1999 (Med Sci Sports Exerc
  31(1):38-45), a narrative review of resistance-training prescription that
  reports no increment experiment. There is nothing further downstream to
  follow. The 2026 stand (Currier, D'Souza et al., Phillips, Med Sci Sports
  Exerc 58(4):851-872) revisits progression and does not mention increment
  magnitude at all; treating that as a retraction would be an argument from
  silence, so it is recorded as one and no further weight is placed on it. The
  only experimental manipulation of increment size is Hostler et al. 2001, and
  its design bounds are severe: 19 untrained participants, upper-body pressing
  only, no equivalence machinery, and an author-stated hint in the direction
  OPPOSITE the popular reading. Two adjacent trials that are frequently
  recruited into increment arguments do not actually address the question:
  Plotkin et al. 2022 compares load progression with rep progression but never
  specifies the increment it used, and Chaves et al. 2024 likewise varies
  modality, not magnitude (both handled on
  exercise/progression-modality-load-vs-reps-028). The practitioner tables that
  do supply numbers point in a direction most gym-floor discussion has
  backwards -- more-trained lifters get LARGER absolute steps -- but their
  primary locator could not be verified, so they are stored at the floor of the
  ladder with the attribution problem stated rather than smoothed over. Two
  popular supports were removed entirely during verification: the physiological
  "upper body adapts slower" argument, whose usual citation has a label-swapped
  abstract and a non-significant primary effect, and the acute:chronic
  workload-ratio injury threshold, which is contested at its own source and
  describes a different quantity in a different sport. Contested flag is set
  because two live claims in this space -- "increment size matters" and "1% more
  load is 1% more stimulus" -- are stored as disputed and disfavoured rather
  than resolved.

# exercise/load-increment-size-evidence-gap-027

Nobody knows how big a weight jump should be. That sentence is the finding, and
it is worth stating plainly because the topic is unusually rich in confident
numbers.

The number most people are repeating, whether they know it or not, is the
American College of Sports Medicine's 2009 guidance: when you can beat your rep
target by one or two reps on two sessions in a row, add 2 to 10 percent to the
bar -- nearer 2 percent on small-muscle exercises, nearer 10 percent on big
ones. That is a sensible-sounding rule, and this warehouse checked where it came
from. It has one supporting citation, and that citation is a 1999 review article
about how to prescribe resistance training. It is not an experiment. Nobody
compared 2 percent against 10 percent and measured what happened. The rule is a
committee's reasoned prescription that has been repeated for fifteen years until
it acquired the texture of a result.

The 2026 update of the same position stand says nothing at all about how much
weight to add. That is not the same as taking the old number back, and it is not
treated here as if it were -- an absence of discussion is weak evidence about
anything. What the 2026 stand does say is that progression is not required for
benefit, and that increasing the stimulus is likely necessary only for people
chasing continued long-term progress.

Exactly one study has ever actually manipulated the size of the jump. In 2001,
nineteen untrained people trained the bench press and triceps press with either
half-pound micro-increments or conventional ones. Micro-loading came out "as
effective as" conventional loading -- but the study never set up the statistics
that would let it claim equivalence, and with nineteen people split across two
groups it could not have detected a modest difference if one existed. The
authors themselves added that their preliminary data hinted the conventional
program might be the better method over a longer stretch. So the honest summary
of the entire experimental literature on increment size is: one small study on
untrained people doing upper-body pressing, which failed to find a difference
and gently suggested the difference might favour bigger jumps.

There is a claim circulating on training-gear blogs that a study in the Journal
of Strength and Conditioning Research showed smaller increments produce more
consistent strength gains. Two passes of this sprint concluded that study did
not exist. A third pass found that it does -- it is the 2001 study above -- and
that it says close to the opposite of what is being attributed to it. Both
halves of that correction are recorded here, because "no such study exists" and
"the study exists and is being misquoted" call for different responses when
someone brings the claim up.

Two things survive that are worth carrying. The first is arithmetic, and it
needs no research at all: a fixed weight jump is a big relative step on a light
lift and a small one on a heavy lift. Two and a half kilos is over four percent
of a sixty-kilo bench press and under two percent of a hundred-and-forty-kilo
squat. If you want a reason to use finer plates on your presses than on your
squats, that is the reason -- not any claim that upper-body muscle adapts more
slowly. The evidence usually cited for the slow-upper-body story is a
meta-analysis in young trained women whose published abstract has its upper and
lower labels swapped, whose headline effect was not statistically significant
until an extreme outlier was removed after the fact, and which found no
upper-versus-lower difference at all in beginners.

The second survivor is a direction that most gym-floor discussion has backwards.
The strength-and-conditioning reference tables that do give numbers recommend
BIGGER absolute jumps for more experienced lifters, not smaller ones -- roughly
two-and-a-half to five pounds upper body and five to ten lower for the
less-trained, rising to five-to-ten-plus and ten-to-fifteen-plus for the
more-trained. The direction is the interesting part; the numbers themselves come
from a coaching reference whose original source this sprint could not verify, so
they are held loosely and no table is quoted as authoritative.

Finally, one claim is dropped rather than softened. The figure that progressing
load faster than fifteen percent per week raises injury risk by twenty-one to
forty-nine percent does not belong anywhere near a training tool. It comes from
the acute-to-chronic workload literature in team sports, describes weekly total
workload rather than the weight on a barbell, has no causal design behind it,
and its central figure has a retraction request filed against it. The
accompanying truth is simply that no study has connected the size of a
per-session weight jump to injury in either direction. Arguments for a
conservative increment can be made from sustainability or from technique. They
cannot be made from injury data, because there is none.
